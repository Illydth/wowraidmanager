<H1>Recurring Raids Help</H1>

Recurring Raids is a new addition to WRM that allows raid administators less hastle in creating and scheduling raids.<br>  
<br>
When the admin sets up a re-occuring raid he or she is setting up a raid that will continue scheduing itself INDEFINATELY until deleted with<br>
a max number showing at one time as identified by the raid administrator.  For every raid marked "recurring" in the system, a new raid will be<br>
created that is a copy of the old raid in the selected interval up to the number of raids identifed by the raid admin.<br>
<br>
Recurring raids can be setup using the "raids" section of WRM under the "New Raid" button.  While in "New Raid" there is a section just under<br>
the Raid Information section (Location, Date, Freeze, Description, etc.) that allows the admin to setup a recurring raid.<br>
<br>
There are three options for a raid admin to set:<br>
<ul>
     <li>Recurring Raid Checkbox: Checking this box tells the WRM system to make this raid a recurring raid.  Unchecking the box turns off
     recurrance for this raid.</li>
     <li>Reoccurance Interval: This dropdown box allows for the selection of Daily, Weekly or Monthly recurrance of the raid.
     	<ul>
     		<li>Daily: Raid reoccurs daily at the same start and end time for the same dungeon.</li>
     		<li>Weekly: Raid reoccurs every week on the same day of the week as set in the date box above.</li>
     		<li>Monthly: Raid reoccurs every month on the same day of the month as set in the date box above.</li>
     	</ul>
     </li>
     <li>Number of Intervals to Show: This box lists the total number of intervals that will be kept visible at one time.   As soon as 
     the start date/time of a raid occurs a new raid will be generated at the next interval.</li>
</ul>
Please see the examples below for a better description.<br>
<br>
<b>NOTE:</b> Raid Reoccurance is ONLY available to those profiles granted the "Raids" permission.  Normal users CANNOT set up re-occuring raids.<br>
<br>
<h2>Examples</h2>
<b>Requirement:</b> A guild wants to set up a raid for a particular instance that runs every day at 8:30pm.  They want users to be able to sign up<br>
for a week's worth of raids at a time (7 days).<br>
<b>Solution:</b> The raid admin sets up a raid and selects the next date the instance will run.  The admin then checks the "recurrance" box to tell<br>
the system that this is a recurring raid.  He or she then selects "Daily" from the dropdown box (telling the software to make this raid re-occur<br>
every day).  Finally the admin types a 7 into the "Number of Intervals to Show" box telling the system to keep 7 copies of that raid available<br>
to the users to sign up to.<br>
<b>Software:</b> Lets assume for this example that the raid was created Sunday night and set for Monday at 8:30pm start.  When the new raid is created<br>
the software will immediately (upon page reload) create 7 copies of that raid (because the number of intervals to show = 7).  So a new raid will<br>
appear for Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday (7 new raids will be shown on the front page all with the exact<br>
same Location, Invite and Start time, Dungeon, Description, Limits, etc.).  As soon as the start date/time for the next occurance of that raid<br>
has passed (at 8:30:01pm Monday Night) the system will generate a new raid for the occurance (Monday 8:30pm).<br> 
<br>
<br>
<b>Requirement:</b> A guild wants to set up a raid for a particular instance that runs every Tuesday at 8:30pm.  They want users to be able to sign up<br>
for a Month's worth of raids at a time.<br>
<b>Solution:</b> First the raid admin sets up the raid and sets the date to the next occurance of the raid (the Upcoming Tuesday).  The raid admin would<br>
check the "recurrance" box to tell the system that this is a recurring raid.  He or she then selects "Weekly" from the Reoccurance Interval<br>
dropdown box to make the system generate this raid every week.  He then types a 4 into the Number of Intervals to Show box to allow users to<br>
sign up for up to a month's worth of raids.<br>
<b>Software:</b> When this occuring raid is created the software will immediately generate a raid record for the next 4 Tuesdays (The upcoming one<br>
and the 3 following that).  When the upcoming Tuesday's raid start date/time is past (8:30:01 pm) a new raid will be generated by the system<br>
for the 5th Tuesday.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Requirement:</b> A guild wants to set up a raid for a particular instance that runs every Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday at 8:30pm.  They want the<br>
users to be able to sign up for a month of raids (4 each of the T/W/Th raids) at a time.<br>
<b>Solution:</b> The raid admin would go through the same steps above for EACH day (Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday) setting up one recurring raid for<br>
each of the three days (i.e. He or she would set up 3 new raids, each with the recurrance flag turned on and with the same settings as in <br>
the example just above this one.<br>
<b>Software:</b> As with the example above, the software will create a new raid as each Raid Start Date/Time is past.  This means that a new Tuesday<br>
raid will be setup when the Tuesday Date/Time is past but NOT the entire week (Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday).  For the new Wednesday raid, the<br>
users will have to wait till Wednesday's Raid Start Date/Time is past...same with Thursday.
<br>
<br>
<b>Requirement:</b> A guild wants to set up a raid for a particular day of the month, every month.  They want 2 months of signups to be available.<br> 
<b>Solution:</b> As with the weekly example above, the raid admin would check the recurrance box, select "Monthly" from the dropdown and type a 2 into<br>
the Number of Intervals box.<br>
<b>Software:</b> Again as with weekly above 2 raids would be generated by the system for this month and next month.  When the Raid start date/time for<br>
this month's raid passes the system would setup the raid for the 3rd month.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Requirement:</b> A guild wants to set up a raid for multiple days of the month, every month.<br>
<b>Solution:</b> Combine the Multiple Days of the Week example with the Month Example above.  The raid admin sets up raids on each day of the month he<br>
or she wants to schedule raids on and then selects recurrance on each of them.<br>
<b>Software:</b> As each day of the month passes the next raid for that day on the next applicable month will be created.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Requirement:</b> A guild wants to set up a raid for the 3rd Tuesday of the Month every month.<br>
<b>Solution:</b> Manual<br>
<b>Software:</b> The WRM software does not support this kind of scheduling methodology.  Either the raid admin will need to manually schedule these<br>
raids, or the guild will have to move to a "x day of the month" or "x day of the week" mentality.<br> 
<br>
<h2>Stopping Recurring Raids</h2>
To stop a raid from having it's next occurance scheduled you will need to go back into the raid under the recurring raids list (not the normal<br>
list of raids but the raids in the recurring raid list) and delete the raid.  <b>This will NOT delete any already created raids.</b>  Those<br>
will have to be deleted from the normal raid list one by one.<br>
<br>
<h2>Modifying Recurring Raids</h2>
You can modify the occurances of the raids that are <i>created</i> through this process but you <b>cannot</b> modify the recurring raid record<br>
itself.  If I have a recurring raid that creates a new raid every day at 8:30pm I can modify tomorrow's created 8:30pm occurance in the same way<br>
I would modify any raid record.  I cannot, however, modify the record that creates a new occurance of that raid at 8:30.  If I need to make<br>
modifications to that record I would need to delete the old recurrance record, then delete any raids already created by this record, and then set<br>
up a new recurrance record with the modified information which would then create the new raids based upon that new information.<br>
<br>
<h2>Modifying/Deleting Raids Created Through the Recurrance Process</h2>
Modifying raids created by the recurrance process is a bit different than modifying raids that are not created through this process.<br>
The main change is that the recurring raids scheduler checks for raid start time and date and schedules any missing raids.  Because of this<br>
you CANNOT delete recurring raids scheduled through the recurrance process...they will simply be re-created.  You CAN modify raids created<br>
in this way SO LONG AS you do NOT modify the Raid Start Date/Time, if you do a new raid will be created at the old raid Start.<br>
<br>
If you modify any raid's start date/time (either by deleting the raid or by modifying the date/time of the record) created by the scheduler<br>
the scheduler will re-create another raid for you. In other words, if a raid is scheduled at 9:00 pm a week from now as part of the Recurring Raids<br>
process, and you delete that record another raid scheduled at 9:00 pm on that same day will be immediately created.  If a raid is scheduled at 9:00<br>
pm a week from now and you modify that raid start time to read 9:30 pm, a new raid starting at 9:00 PM will be immediately created (so you now have<br>
2 raids, one at 9 and one at 9:30 for the same instance).<br>
<br>
To modify an instance of a recurring raid's start time or to delete an instance of a recurring raid you MUST delete the recurring raid from the<br>
recurring raids section in the raids area of WRM, THEN modify the start time or delete the record.  If you want to continue scheduling raids,<br>
re-setup the recurring raid for a date AFTER the skip.<br>
