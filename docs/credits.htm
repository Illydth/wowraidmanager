Due to the extensive modifications on phpRaid and a new developer taking over the project,<br>
i've opted to go to a credits file to store all the individual contributions to phpRaid<br>
over the course of it's history.  If you have contributed to phpRaid in a significant<br>
way and feel you belong here but are not listed, please contact me and i'll be happy to <br>
add you.<br>
<br>
To begin with, Credit for the majority of this code goes out to Kile Spraggs, the origial <br>
developer of phpRaid.  I should note that his original copyright (© 2005-2006 Kyle Spraggs)<br>
is still in place as much of the code is still at it's base his original creation.<br>
<br>
Individual Updates to the Code since the 3.0.7 Major release are as follows:<br>
* Version 3.0.8 Updated and fixed by Schwick<br>
* Version 3.0.9 Updated by Zeriz<br>
* Calendar View Created by Keldrak on the phpRaider Boards<br>
<br>
And as noted on the front page, the 3.1 code has been created and is now being maintained<br>
by Douglas Wagner: douglasw at wagnerweb dot org.  I do claim copyright for the 3.1<br>
release (© 2007 Douglas Wagner) of phpRaid and the modifications to the origial source<br>
contained within.<br>
<br>
Many thanks go out to my guild, Tenebrae Cor on the World of Warcraft Alleria Server for<br>
their help and testing of each new release, and specifically to "Triden" for his help<br>
and assistance on code.<br>
<br>
