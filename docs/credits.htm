Due to the extensive modifications on phpRaid and a new developer taking over the project,<br>
i've opted to go to a credits file to store all the individual contributions to phpRaid<br>
over the course of it's history.  If you have contributed to phpRaid in a significant<br>
way and feel you belong here but are not listed, please contact me and i'll be happy to <br>
add you.<br>
<br>
To begin with, Credit for the majority of this code goes out to Kile Spraggs, the origial <br>
developer of phpRaid.  I should note his original copyright (ï¿½ 2005-2006 Kyle Spraggs)<br>
, though by GPL he doesn't own the copyright anymore, much of the work is still his<br>
original coding and he diserves kudos for the origial work.<br>
<br>
Next, a big thank you to all of the various people involved who have made or brought this code up<br>
to where it is now.  A listing is included below:<br>
<br>
Individual Updates to the Code since the 3.0.7 Major release are as follows:<br>
* Version 3.0.8 Updated and fixed by Schwick<br>
* Version 3.0.9 Updated by Zeriz<br>
* Calendar View Created by Keldrak on the phpRaider Boards<br>
<br>
Language Updates:<br>
* Alohastone for providing the original 3.0.9.2 German Translation for inclusion.<br>
* Nalumis for providing the full 3.1.2 German Translation that has been merged into base.<br>
<br>
External Libraries<br>
* A quick thank you to the guys at phplib for our templates.php file that handles<br> 
all of our session management and a bunch of other rather arduous tasks.<br>
* Another big thank you to Mr. David Clark from theCalico.com for our reports.php file that<br>
is pretty much the entire look and feel of phpRaid (all of the table views are generated by<br>
this beast).
<br><br>
And as noted on the front page, the 3.1 and beyond code has been created and is now being maintained<br>
by Douglas Wagner: douglasw at wagnerweb dot org.  I do claim copyright for the 3.1<br>
release ( (C) 2007-2008 Douglas Wagner ) of phpRaid/WoW Raid Manager and the modifications to<br>
the origial source contained within.<br>
<br>
Many thanks go out to my guild, Tenebrae Cor on the World of Warcraft Alleria Server for<br>
their help and testing of each new release, and specifically to "Triden" for his help<br>
and assistance on code.<br>
<br>
Any issues, corrections, comments, or notations of omissions on this credits file should be<br>
