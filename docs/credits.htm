Due to the extensive modifications on phpRaid and a new developer taking over the project,<br>
i've opted to go to a credits file to store all the individual contributions to phpRaid<br>
over the course of it's history.  If you have contributed to phpRaid in a significant<br>
way and feel you belong here but are not listed, please contact me and i'll be happy to <br>
add you.<br>
<br>
To begin with, Credit for at least some of this code goes out to Kile Spraggs, the origial <br>
developer of phpRaid.  I should note his original copyright (ï¿½ 2005-2006 Kyle Spraggs)<br>
, though by GPL he doesn't own the copyright anymore, some of the work is still his<br>
original coding and he diserves kudos for the origial work.<br>
<br>
Next, a big thank you to all of the various people involved who have made or brought this code up<br>
to where it is now.  A listing is included below:<br>
<br>
Individual Updates to the Code since the 3.0.7 Major release are as follows:<br>
* Version 3.0.8 Updated and fixed by Schwick<br>
* Version 3.0.9 Updated by Zeriz<br>
* Calendar View Created by Keldrak on the phpRaider Boards<br>
<br>
Foreign Libraries:<br>
Our template system is now Smarty (http://www.smarty.net).  Smarty is released under the LGPL<br>
license and thus is allowed to be distributed with this software.  Thanks go out to the Smarty<br>
people for such a robust and dynamic templating language.
<br>
Language Updates:<br>
* Alohastone for providing the original 3.0.9.2 German Translation for inclusion.<br>
* Nalumis for providing the full 3.1.2 German Translation that has been merged into base.<br>
<br>
And as noted on the front page, the 3.1 and beyond code has been created and is now being maintained<br>
by Douglas Wagner: douglasw at wagnerweb dot org.  I do claim copyright for the 4.0<br>
release ( (C) 2007-2009 Douglas Wagner ) of phpRaid/WoW Raid Manager (and all previous releases
from 3.1 through the current) and the modifications to the origial source contained within.<br>
<br>
Many thanks go out to my guild, Tenebrae Cor on the World of Warcraft Alleria Server for<br>
their help and testing of each new release, and specifically to "Triden" for his help<br>
and assistance on code and "Elayneff" with her assistance with RIM.<br>
<br>
Any issues, corrections, comments, or notations of omissions on this credits file should be<br>
