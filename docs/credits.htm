Due to the extensive modifications on phpRaid and a new developer taking over the project,<br>
i've opted to go to a credits file to store all the individual contributions to phpRaid<br>
over the course of it's history.  If you have contributed to phpRaid in a significant<br>
way and feel you belong here but are not listed, please contact me and i'll be happy to <br>
add you.<br>
<br>
To begin with, Credit for at least some of this code goes out to Kile Spraggs, the original <br>
developer of phpRaid.  I should note his original copyright (&copy; 2005-2006 Kyle Spraggs)<br>
, though by GPL he doesn't own the copyright anymore, some of the work is still his<br>
original coding and he deserves kudos for the original work.<br>
<br>
Next, a big thank you to all of the various people involved who have made or brought this code up<br>
to where it is now.  A listing is included below:<br>
<br>
Individual Updates to the Code since the 3.0.7 Major release are as follows:<br>
* Version 3.0.8 Updated and fixed by Schwick<br>
* Version 3.0.9 Updated by Zeriz<br>
<br>
Foreign Libraries:<br>
Our template system is now Smarty (http://www.smarty.net).  Smarty is released under the LGPL<br>
license and thus is allowed to be distributed with this software.  Thanks go out to the Smarty<br>
people for such a robust and dynamic templating language.
<br>
Language Updates:<br>
* Alohastone for providing the original 3.0.9.2 German Translation for inclusion.<br>
* Nalumis for providing the full 3.1.2 German Translation that has been merged into base.<br>
* Nalumis for maintaining the German Translation of WRM.<br>
* Lore21 for maintaining the Italian Translation of WRM.<br>
* Litago for maintaining the Norwegan Translation of WRM.<br>
* Srshyu for maintaining the Traditional Chinese Translation of WRM.<br>
* Arrogant for maintaining the French Translation of WRM.<br>
* Marix for maintaining the Sweedish Translation of WRM.<br>
<br>
Overlib/Armory Popups<br>
Thanks go out to the maintainers of phpArmory (though now no longer supported) at the sourceforge site<br>
"mepcotterell" and "poeticdragon".  Of note, the code has been updated and extended by "Daniel" of<br>
www.marenkay.com, and is now 0.4.2.  Again, kudos to shiena of sourceforge.net (Daniel) for picking<br>
this up and maintaining it.

Raid Icons<br>
* A special thank you to JDDMichael from wowraidmanager.net for his creation of all of the new raid<br>
icons shipped with this release.  You can find all of his icons in /templates/SpiffyJr/images/instances<br>
and the associated directories below that.  These graphics are released with the software again under the<br>
GPL with the rest of the software and with full permission of the author.  The "source" directory contains<br>
the original work in a .psd (photoshop) format that is accessible both under photoshop as well as under<br>
The Gimp in Linux.  As with all GPL software you have full rights to modify these icons along with the<br>
rest of the software, but the author has requested that I include the original file for ease of modification<br>
of the icons.<br>
<br>
And as noted on the front page, the 3.1 and beyond code has been created and is now being maintained<br>
by Douglas Wagner: douglasw at wagnerweb dot org.  I do claim copyright for the 4.0<br>
release ( (C) 2007-2009 Douglas Wagner ) of phpRaid/WoW Raid Manager (and all previous releases
from 3.1 through the current) and the modifications to the original source contained within.<br>
<br>
Many thanks go out to my guild, Tenebrae Cor on the World of Warcraft Alleria Server for<br>
their help and testing of each new release, and specifically to "Triden" for his help<br>
and assistance on code and "Elayneff" with her assistance with RIM.<br>
<br>
Any issues, corrections, comments, or notations of omissions on this credits file should be<br>
addressed to douglasw at wagnerweb dot org.<br>
