WoW Raid Manager License

The WoW Raid Manager (phpRaid) license has now been fully implemented.

WOW Raid Manager (otherwise known as phpRaid) is licensed via the GNU GPL v3.0 license.

All code headers should now read:

As well a copy of the GNU GPL Version 3.0 has been included in Docs/gpl-3.0.txt

Prior versions of phpRaid (3.0.9.x, 3.1.x) are licensed via the GNU GPL v2.0 license, however
it was brought to my attention that the license was not fully implemented according to the
requirements of the GPL, that said, the intent was always to license this software via the
GPL.  For those versions that I maintain (versions 3.1.x), whether I explicitly hold the 
copyright in the code or not, I maintain the license on the files as the GNU GPL v2 license.   

For version 3.2.x and above the license has changed to the GNU v3.0 license and the software 
will be released via that license from now on.  The full text of the GNU 3.0 license can be
be found in the Docs/gpl-3.0.txt file or on www.gnu.org/licenses.

*** Overlib/WOW Armory Popups: ***
------------------------------------
With the addition of the WoW Armory Popups and Overlib to the WRM code, it needs to be noted
that the GPL v3 license no longer applies to the ENTIRE code base.  To start with overLIB is
distributed under an "Artistic" license from www.bosrup.com which you can read about Here:
http://www.bosrup.com/web/overlib/?License.  The license does allow it's use in this software, 
but is NOT GPL v3 like the rest of my code.  Please be aware when creating derivative works of 
WRM that the code here may or may not be supported (Overlib can be re-distributed and "derived" 
from according to the license above).

More problematic is the wow armory code itself.  This was originally obtained as a phpBB MOD to
add additional bb codes to a phpBB board to obtain information from the armory.  However, the
character and item retrieval code is VERY stable and very portable, it being developed as an 
underlying interface to the armory where the BB code simply calls the retrieval code through 
a pre-described manor making this suitable for use for pretty much any online application, not 
just phpBB.  The problem is that the code is distributed completely without copyright or license
attached to it anywhere.  While, legally, this allows me to use this code with impunity, it 
makes me quite uncomfortable to do so, however the benefit to the WRM code to implement something 
like this is huge.  As such I have decided to go ahead with the distribution of this tool and 
integration into WRM.  I will note that the code was originally written by Shantalya of the 
armory.deluxe-board.com site and I attribute everything under the wowchar-tooltip and 
wowitem-tooltip directories to him/her.  I have posted a message under the appropriate thread
(you can see it on page 9 at http://armory.deluxe-board.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=2) asking
the developer's permission to implement this with regards to WRM, but as it is right now without
copyright or license I should be within full rights to do so.  Also note that phpBB's own license
(Creative Commons) would give me the right to distribute this with WRM if mods for phpBB are
encompassed by the CC License.

If, at some point, I get an e-mail or post back to this thread telling me to remove it or
otherwise asking me not to use this software I will remove this from the base distribution of WRM
and identify this as a "modification" that can be made by users to the software at their own 
risk.  For now, however, I am formally stating that this code IS NOT MINE however I feel I have 
a right to distribute it with WRM and given it's value add to my software and my users, I feel 
this is the right thing to do.

If there are any questions about the above or other license questions, please
direct them to douglasw at wagnerweb dot org or to the www.wowraidmanager.net website.
