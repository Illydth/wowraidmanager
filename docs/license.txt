WoW Raid Manager License

The WoW Raid Manager (phpRaid) license has now been fully implemented.

WOW Raid Manager (otherwise known as phpRaid) is licensed via the GNU GPL v3.0 license.

All code headers should now read:

As well a copy of the GNU GPL Version 3.0 has been included in Docs/gpl-3.0.txt

Prior versions of phpRaid (3.0.9.x, 3.1.x) are licensed via the GNU GPL v2.0 license, however
it was brought to my attention that the license was not fully implemented according to the
requirements of the GPL, that said, the intent was always to license this software via the
GPL.  For those versions that I maintain (versions 3.1.x), whether I explicitly hold the 
copyright in the code or not, I maintain the license on the files as the GNU GPL v2 license.   

For version 3.2.x and above the license has changed to the GNU v3.0 license and the software 
will be released via that license from now on.  The full text of the GNU 3.0 license can be
be found in the Docs/gpl-3.0.txt file or on www.gnu.org/licenses.

If there are any questions about the above or other license questions, please
