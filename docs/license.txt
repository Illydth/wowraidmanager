WoW Raid Manager License

The WoW Raid Manager (phpRaid) license has now been fully implemented.

WOW Raid Manager (otherwise known as phpRaid) is licensed via the GNU GPL v3.0 license.

All code headers should now read:

/***************************************************************************

As well a copy of the GNU GPL Version 3.0 has been included in Docs/gpl-3.0.txt

Prior versions of phpRaid (3.0.9.x, 3.1.x) are licensed via the GNU GPL v2.0 license, however
it was brought to my attention that the license was not fully implemented according to the
requirements of the GPL, that said, the intent was always to license this software via the
GPL.  For those versions that I maintain (versions 3.1.x), whether I explicitly hold the 
copyright in the code or not, I maintain the license on the files as the GNU GPL v2 license.   

For version 3.2.x and above the license has changed to the GNU v3.0 license and the software 
will be released via that license from now on.  The full text of the GNU 3.0 license can be
be found in the Docs/gpl-3.0.txt file or on www.gnu.org/licenses.

WRM 4.0 is still released under the v3.0 GPL License.

*** WOW Armory Popups: ***
------------------------------------
The new Armory code (from phparmory.sourceforge.net) is released under the GPL v2 or at my discretion
any later version.  Due to this, this brings the entire code base back under the GPL.  The header above, 
though not attached to the wowarmory code, applies to the entire code base again.

A new version of the Armory Code (0.3 -> 0.4.2) is released by a different developer and is now released
under the GPL v3.0 Licence, again bringing the code base back to license commonality.  Once the 0.4.2 
version of the Armory code is implemented the entire code base will be released under the GPLv3 license.

If there are any questions about the above or other license questions, please
