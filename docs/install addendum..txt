-Upgrading from 3.0.6,3.0.7, or 3.0.8

Fairly straight forward process, make sure you select not only the correct version your upgrading from but the correct faction.  If you accidently select the wrong faction and procede forward with the change (ie your database tables get updated) contact Zeriz (morningstarzero@gmail.com) for assistance resolving the issue.

-Templates

If you are using a custom template, I'll garentee that they changes made in this update will break it due to the support of all 9 classes in a raid.  you'll need to update the following files at the very least (refrence included updated SpiffyJr template for details):

locations_new.htm
raids_new.htm
view_raid.htm
footer.htm (not a functional update, mearly versioning credit.)
