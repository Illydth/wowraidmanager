-------------------
* Unpackage the files from this archive into a directory on your local machine.
* Open your FTP program and upload the entire contents of this archive to your web host,
	including the phpRaid directory.
* Change the Ownership of all files to match that of your web server.  Check the list above
	to ensure that everything listed in step 4 above is writable.  
* Run the Installation application and select "Upgrade to 3.5.1".  Follow the installer all
    the way through to the end (much of your prior information should be already set) and 
    make sure to properly re-set your authentication method (if it's not pre-selected for you)
    already).
* Note: Templates other than "SpiffyJr" are likely NOT to work with 3.5.1 for a while till the template
	editors get a chance to upgrade them.  Please switch back to SpiffyJr till the templates get updated.
* Note: You can remove the "Scripts" directory under any templates you are using, they are no longer used.

Installing WRM into a supported CMS system
-----------------------------------------------
At the time of this writing 3.6.0 supports the following CMS systems:

* e107 from http://www.e107.org
* Joomla from http://www.joomla.org (v1.5 ONLY) (NEW)
* phpBB from http://www.phpbb.com (v2 and v3)
* SMF from http://www.simplemachines.org/ (v1 and v2)
* WBB from http://www.woltlab.com/products/burning_board/index_en.php
* XOOPS from http://www.xoops.org/

Also supported, if you do not have a supported CMS system, is the "iUMS" (previously phpRaid) installation,
which is the default non-CMS supported installation.  

If you DO intend to install this application into a CMS please note that it is a
REQUIREMENT that you install your WRM database INTO your CMS database, at the
moment you CANNOT separate the databases and have everything work.  

When entering the database information to install to, please ensure that you install
into your CMS database to get CMS integration to work.
