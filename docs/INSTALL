Quick Upgrade
-------------------
* Unpackage the files from this archive into a directory on your local machine.
* Open your FTP program and upload the entire contents of this archive to your web host,
	including the phpRaid directory.
* Change the Ownership of all files to match that of your web server.  Check the list above
	to ensure that everything listed in step 4 above is writable.  
* Go to "install/database_schema/upgrade" 
* Log in to your MySQL server installation and into your phpRaid database
* Run appropriate .sql files through a program like phpMyAdmin to move from your version of 
	WRM to the 3.2.1 version to make sure that the appropriate changes to your database have
	been made.  
	
*** NOTE *** 

The SQL in these files assumes you are using the default table names for phpRaid.  If
in your original installation you chose to use a table prefix other than phpraid_ you
will need to modify the SQL you are applying to include your table prefix.  You should
be able to use a search and replace on phpraid_ and change that to your table prefix
(in my case that would be phpraid_TC_)


Installing phpRaid into a supported CMS system
-----------------------------------------------
At the time of this writing 3.2.1 supports the following CMS systems:

* e107 from http://www.e107.org
* phpBB from http://www.phpbb.com (v2 only)

Note: phpBB Version 3 has support in this version through a patch on www.wowraidmanager.net
however this code has not been offically merged into the release and is supported by it's
maintainer for the moment. 

Also supported, if you do not have a supported CMS system, is "phpRaid" installation,
which is the default non-CMS supported installation.  

If you do intend to install this application into a CMS please note that it is a
REQUIREMENT that you install your phpRaid database INTO your CMS database, at the
moment you CANNOT separate the databases and have everything work.  

When entering the database information to install to, please ensure that you install
into your CMS database to get CMS integration to work.


Template Changes - v3.2.1
------------------------------
This version makes minor changes to the WRM template system.  Particularly there are two
major changes:

* header.htm has had several lines loaded at the top in the "script" and "link" area at
	the top.
	
* configuration.htm has had a few lines added in the guild configuration section to support
	the new armory linking.
	
	
Language Changes - v3.2.1
------------------------------
Two new strings were added to the lang_pages.php in the "configuration" section.
	* $phprlang['configuration_anonymous'] = 'Allow anonymous viewing';
	* $phprlang['configuration_armory_link_text'] = 'Correct Armory Link for Server';

These strings have not been translated at this point.
