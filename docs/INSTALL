Quick Upgrade
-------------------
* Unpackage the files from this archive into a directory on your local machine.
* Open your FTP program and upload the entire contents of this archive to your web host,
	including the phpRaid directory.
* Change the Ownership of all files to match that of your web server.  
* Go to "install/database_schema/upgrade" 
* Log in to your MySQL server installation and into your phpRaid database
* Run 3.1.0.sql and 3.1.1.sql to make the appropriate changes to your
	database for the 3.1.0 and 3.1.1 version of phpRaid.  
	
*** NOTE *** 

The SQL in these files assumes you are using the default table names for phpRaid.  If
in your original installation you chose to use a table prefix other than phpraid_ you
will need to modify the SQL you are applying to include your table prefix.  You should
be able to use a search and replace on phpraid_ and change that to your table prefix
(in my case that would be phpraid_TC_)


Installing phpRaid into a supported CMS system
-----------------------------------------------
At the time of this writing 3.1.1 supports the following CMS systems:

* e107 from http://www.e107.org
* phpBB from http://www.phpbb.com

Also supported, if you do not have a supported CMS system, is "phpRaid" installation,
which is the default non-CMS supported installation.  

If you do intend to install this application into a CMS please note that it is a
REQUIREMENT that you install your phpRaid database INTO your CMS database, at the
moment you CANNOT separate the databases and have everything work.  

When entering the database information to install to, please ensure that you install
into your CMS database to get CMS integration to work.


Eratta
-----------------
Unfortunately this release has broken some things, most notably any custom templates you 
may have installed.  More information as follows:

* Raid Signup Flow Change: Due to the change in the code surrounding raid signups
and the flow surrounding signing up for and being accepted into a raid, it may be the 
case that your users have more or less "buttons" (privileges) than they used to.  
You will need to go into the configuration section and modify the signup area checkboxes
to return your signup rights back to the users.  This is documented in docs/signup_flow.txt

* Custom Templates Broken: Due to the additions of SEVERAL sections of code in phpRaid and
some pretty major functionality changes (5 man group support, Teams, 3 levels of
permissions, etc.) there have been several html changes to the templates used by 
phpRaid.  This, likely, will have broken every template that is not "SpiffyJr".
Again in the next release I will try to capture and document html changes to ensure
template maintainers have information on the changes to their templates to ensure
an easy template migration, unfortunately this is not included with this release.
To modify your custom templates you will need to download the "updates" package
(update from 3.0.9.2 to 3.1.0) and check the files under the "Templates" area.  
Use a DIFF tool (I recommend CompareIt! or KDiff3 in windows or any of the numerious
tools in Unix/Linux) to check the modifications between the files included in the
update package against the files in your custom template.  Merge the changes and you
should be all set.

* Missing Documentation: I havn't made an extensive check yet, but i'm betting i'm 
missing a referred to documentation file or two somewhere in the installation.  If
you happen to run across some missing documentation on a feature you know NOTHING 
about, please let me know and i'll get a patch out quickly with it.
