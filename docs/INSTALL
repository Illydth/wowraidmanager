Quick Upgrade
-------------------
* Unpackage the files from this archive into a directory on your local machine.
* Open your FTP program and upload the entire contents of this archive to your web host,
	including the phpRaid directory.
* Change the Ownership of all files to match that of your web server.  Check the list above
	to ensure that everything listed in step 4 above is writable.  
* Run the Installation application and select "Upgrade to 3.5.0".  Follow the installer all
    the way through to the end (much of your prior information should be already set) and 
    make sure to properly re-set your authentication method (if it's not pre-selected for you)
    already).   

Upgrading from a Release Candidate of 3.5
-------------------------------------------
If you are upgrading from another release candidate of 3.5 (RC1, RC2) you should only need to
upload the files to your directory.  There is no real need to run the installer to upgrade your
database as no database changes have taken place.
	
Installing phpRaid into a supported CMS system
-----------------------------------------------
At the time of this writing 3.5.0 supports the following CMS systems:

* e107 from http://www.e107.org
* phpBB from http://www.phpbb.com (v2 and v3)
* SMF from http://www.simplemachines.org/ (v1 and v2)
* WBB from http://www.woltlab.com/products/burning_board/index_en.php
* XOOPS from http://www.xoops.org/

Also supported, if you do not have a supported CMS system, is the "iUMS" (previously phpRaid) installation,
which is the default non-CMS supported installation.  

If you do intend to install this application into a CMS please note that it is a
REQUIREMENT that you install your phpRaid database INTO your CMS database, at the
moment you CANNOT separate the databases and have everything work.  

When entering the database information to install to, please ensure that you install
into your CMS database to get CMS integration to work.

Template Changes - v3.5.0
------------------------------
This version makes minor changes to the WRM template system.  Particularly there are two
major changes:

* header.htm has been changed to support header graphics and a few other modifications.
	
* configuration.htm had several new lines added and a few moved.

* MANY .htm files have changed to have new strings added to them, please diff against the v3.2.1 for all
changes to all template files.	
	
Language Changes - v3.5.0
------------------------------
Major Language Re-Working.  Some of the strings, particularly in the Chinese and Norwegian language 
files are not translated and are still english based.  Most of the strings in German and Italian translations
however are good to go.
