If you are upgrading from a 3.x release to a 4.x release, read "INSTALL_4.0" first before
continuing with these instructions!  

*** FAILING TO DO SO COULD DAMAGE YOUR DATA! ***


INSTALLATION OF WRM 4.1.x:
----------------------------------
If you are upgrading an already installed WRM 4.x.x installation, please see "'Quick' Upgrade 
from 4.0.x to 4.1.0" later in the document.

IN ANY CASE YOU SHOULD READ THE RELEASE NOTES FOR THIS RELEASE PRIOR TO INSTALLATION!
(release_notes.txt).

============================
Quick Installation
============================

Installation of 4.1.0:
-----------------------
* Unpackage the files from this archive into a directory on your local machine.
* Upload the entire contents of this archive to your web host, including your config.php file,
	and including the WRM directory.  MAKE SURE TO UPLOAD TO A CLEAN DIRECTORY.  DO NOT
	and I repeat, DO NOT upload over the top of an existing WRM installation.  This is a rule
	for all 4.0 releases and things rapidly change and whole sections of code are getting 
	moved from place to place. 
* Change the Ownership of all files to match that of your web server.  
* Change the permissions of the following directories and files to be writable by your
	web server user:
	* config.php (see below)
	* cache/ (and all below directories)
* Open a Database Management Tool (like phpMyAdmin).
* While still in the Database Management Tool, please create a new database for your
	new installation.
* Open a web browser and go to your WRM installation (e.g. http://www.yourdomain.com/wrm)
* The installation process should automatically start into "installation" mode.  If it tries
	to start into "Upgrade" mode, please delete your WRM directory and start over.  
	If you are actually upgrading an existing installation, stop reading these instructions
	and go to the instructions below for Quick Upgrade.  DO NOT PERFORM AN UPGRADE WITH 
	THE UPGRADE INSTALLER.
* Proceed through the rest of the installation and follow instructions to install WRM.
* At the end of the installation please remove your Install directory (delete it completely)
* Change the permissions on your config.php file back to read only to the world (you can 
	leave it writable by your web server if you so choose, but it is recommended that
	you make it read only...(400 permissions in Unix).  Keep the permissions of the other
	files and folders listed above writable.

* Please see COMPLETING THE INSTALLATION Below!!!! (Even if you are a new board, you still
	need to follow part of the instructions in that section to make your WRM work).
	
Please see phpRaid_install_doc.pdf for more information.

NOTE on Config.php: Note that the config.php file no longer ships with the software.  
Generally it should be created on the fly by the installation program shipping with WRM but 
in some special cases we have found that the config file is NOT created by the installation 
and the software has problems when being executed.  If, after installation, you do not have
a valid config.php file in your WRM Root Directory, please create one in the following format:

<?php
/*
#**********************************************#
#                                              #
#     auto-generated configuration file        #
#     WoW Raid Manager 3.5.0                   #
#     date: 2008-09-05 - 16:48:10              #
#   Do not change anything in this file!       #
#                                              #
#**********************************************#
*/

global $phpraid_config;
$phpraid_config['db_name'] = '<name of database>';
$phpraid_config['db_host'] = '<name of database host>';
$phpraid_config['db_user'] = '<database login user ID>';
$phpraid_config['db_pass'] = '<database login user password>';
$phpraid_config['db_prefix'] = 'wrm_'; #(Change this only if you have changed the prefix in installation).
$phpraid_config['eqdkp_db_name'] = '';
$phpraid_config['eqdkp_db_host'] = '';
$phpraid_config['eqdkp_db_user'] = '';
$phpraid_config['eqdkp_db_pass'] = '';
$phpraid_config['eqdkp_db_prefix'] = '';
?>

It is safe to leave the eqdkp configuration blank for the moment.  Please see "eqdkp_link.htm" 
in the docs directory for more information on linking WRM with eqdkp.


"Quick" Upgrade from 4.0.x to 4.0.4
-----------------------------------
IF YOU ARE UPGRADING FROM 3.X or 4.0 BETA TO A 4.0.X INSTALLTION YOU SHOULD NOT BE FOLOWING THESE
INSTRUCTIONS.  SEE BELOW.

If you are already on a 4.0.x release (4.0.0, 4.0.1, 4.0.2, 4.0.3, 4.0.4) then you can follow 
this process to upgrade your installation to 4.1.x.

As always, due to updates to the default template, go into your configuration section and switch
back to using the "default" template before you perform this upgrade, it is unlikely that any
other templates will work properly for you till they are correctly updated for 4.1.0.  This is
especially important for this version since you will be unable to configure your application 
AT ALL (and thus be unable to change your template without a database update) if you are using
anything OTHER than default at this point.

* Unpackage the files from this archive into a directory on your local machine.
* Open your FTP program and copy down your config.php file to your locally unpacked archive.
* Make sure a second time that you have copied down your config.php file or be prepared to
	remake it by hand.
* DELETE all files and folders inside your current WRM 4.0.x installation directory.  
	Ensure that all files and folders from any prior WRM release version have been completely 
    deleted from your WRM directory on your host (NOT LOCAL).  
* Upload the entire contents of this archive to your web host, including your config.php file,
	and including the WRM directory.  MAKE SURE TO UPLOAD TO A CLEAN DIRECTORY.  DO NOT
	and I repeat, DO NOT upload over the top of an existing WRM installation.  This is a rule
	for all 4.0 releases and things rapidly change and whole sections of code are getting 
	moved from place to place. 
* Change the Ownership of all files to match that of your web server.  
* Change the permissions of the following directories and files to be writable by your
	web server user:
	* config.php (see below)
	* cache/ (and all below directories)
* Open a Database Management Tool (like phpMyAdmin) and execute the SQLs that are in the
	install/database_schema/upgrade directory that apply to you.  If you are currently on 4.0.1
	and you are upgrading to 4.0.3 you would run 4.0.1_4.0.2.sql and 4.0.2_4.0.3.sql into your
	WRM database.  This probably goes without saying but RUN THEM IN ORDER (4.0.1_4.0.2.sql first
	4.0.2_4.0.3.sql second, etc.).  Do not execute SQLs that do not apply to you.
	IF YOU ARE UPGRADING FROM 3.X or 4.0 BETA TO 4.0.3  YOU SHOULD NOT BE FOLOWING THESE
	INSTRUCTIONS.  DO NOT run 4.1.0_4.1.1.sql or any of the TOTC/etc. sql files, these are not
	needed to upgrade to 4.1.0.
* At this point you have upgraded your installation to 4.1.0, please remove your Install 
	directory (delete it completely)
* Change the permissions on your config.php file back to read only to the world (you can 
	leave it writable by your web server if you so choose, but it is recommended that
	you make it read only...(400 permissions in Unix).  Keep the permissions of the other
	files and folders listed above writable.

You should probably go to your configuration section and ensure that you aren't getting an 
error message telling you you're out of date.  If you do, make sure you have upgraded
ALL files.  The most common error experienced in this upgrade is not forceably overwriting
all files or deleting all files in the directory before uploading.  I'm not joking, blow away
your ENTIRE prior installation (other than the config.php file) before uploading.

Completing the Installation
----------------------------------------
PLEASE FOLLOW THESE INSTRUCTIONS OR YOUR GUILD MEMBERS WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SIGN UP FOR RAIDS!

Once you have installed or upgraded your existing configuration, and proceeded to check out the
Admin interface and update any relivant settings there, you will need to perform the following
steps:

1) Exit the Admin Interface.
2) Click on the "Guilds" Link.
3) Update your guild (or create a new guild).
4) Create a Raid Force and link your guild to that raid force.

Once this is done, for existing WRM installations, ALL USERS need to update their profiles
(ALL characters) in the Profile Link to re-attach the guild to their character (even if the
guild shows up properly on their character it is NOT proper in the database).  

The user should edit each character, update their guild (and any other relivant information)
and save each character.

Failure to do so will invalidate the user from signing up to raids. 



Installing WRM into a supported CMS system
-----------------------------------------------
At the time of this writing 4.0 supports the following CMS systems:

* e107 from http://www.e107.org
* Joomla from http://www.joomla.org (v1.5 ONLY) (NEW)
* phpBB from http://www.phpbb.com (v2 and v3)
* SMF from http://www.simplemachines.org/ (v1 and v2)
* WBB from http://www.woltlab.com/products/burning_board/index_en.php
* XOOPS from http://www.xoops.org/

Also supported, if you do not have a supported CMS system, is the "iUMS" (previously phpRaid) 
installation, which is the default non-CMS supported installation.  

If you DO intend to install this application into a CMS please note that it is a
REQUIREMENT that you install your WRM database INTO your CMS database, at the
moment you CANNOT separate the databases and have everything work.  

When entering the database information to install to, please ensure that you install
into your CMS database to get CMS integration to work.
