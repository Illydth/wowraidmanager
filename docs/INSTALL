INSTALLATION OF THE WRM 4.0:
----------------------------------
******************  READ THE ENTIRE FILE FIRST *********************

Especially the section related to your personal installation method COMPLETELY before starting
this process.  YOU CAN LOOSE DATA OR BORK YOUR DATABASE DURING, ESPECIALLY, THE UPGRADE
PROCESS IF YOU DO NOT FOLLOW THESE INSTRUCTIONS.

This is your first, last, and ONLY Warning.

ALL instructions start with "Backup any existing database before executing these instructions."
I recognize that any time the word "Backup" is used most systems people laugh and move on 
with the rest of the instructions.

DO NOT DO THIS.

PARTICUALRY for upgrade installations, but specifically for any installation that has a 
database already existing, you run a risk during migration of completely hosing/borking your
database.  It is mostly untested code you will be running.  While I am fairly confident that
WRM 4 is functioning correctly (at least mostly), I make NO gaurentees about upgrading or 
installing since NEITHER of these processes have been tested extensively.  Again, you have
been warned.

Quick Installation
-------------------
WRM 4.0, as noted on the WRM Boards, is a major re-write of the 3.x versions of WRM.  

Installation of Beta:

* Unpackage the files from this archive into a directory on your local machine.
* Open your FTP program and DELETE any old beta versions of WRM.  Ensure that all files
    and folders from any prior WRM BETA version have been completely deleted.  ALL WRM
    4.0 INSTALLATIONS SHOULD BE DONE AS INSTALLS NOT UPGRADES (see Upgrading Below).    
* Open your FTP program and upload the entire contents of this archive to your web host,
	including the WRM directory.  MAKE SURE TO UPLOAD TO A BRAND NEW DIRECTORY.  DO NOT
	and I repeat, DO NOT upload over the top of an existing WRM installation. 
* Change the Ownership of all files to match that of your web server.  
* Change the permissions of the following directories and files to be writable by your
	web server user:
	* config.php (see below)
	* cache/ (and all below directories)
* Open a Database Management Tool (like phpMyAdmin) and DELETE any existing WRM BETA
	databases.  DO NOT DELETE ANY PRODUCTION DATABASES YOU HAVE.
* While still in the Database Management Tool, please create a new database for your
	new installation.
* Open a web browser and go to your WRM installation (e.g. http://www.yourdomain.com/wrm)
* Choose your installation method (ALWAYS INSTALL) and follow the steps to install your 
	WoW Raid Manager server.  
* At the end of the installation please remove your Install directory (delete it completely)
* Change the permissions on your config.php file back to read only to the world (you can 
	leave it writable by your web server if you so choose, but it is recommended that
	you make it read only...(400 permissions in Unix).  Keep the permissions of the other
	files and folders listed above writable.
	
Please see phpRaid_install_doc.pdf for more information.

NOTE on Config.php: Note that the config.php file no longer ships with the software.  Generally
it should be created on the fly by the installation program shipping with WRM but in some special
cases we have found that the config file is NOT created by the installation and the software has
problems when being executed.  If, after installation, you do not have a valid config.php file in 
your WRM Root Directory, please create one in the following format:

<?php

global $phpraid_config;
$phpraid_config['db_name'] = '<name of database>';

It is safe to leave the eqdkp configuration blank for the moment.  Please see "eqdkp_link.htm" in
the docs directory for more information on linking WRM with eqdkp.

"Quick" Upgrade (not really quick)
-----------------------------------
Upgrading WRM from 3.6.x (Release) or 3.9.9.x.x (Beta) is NOT recommended for non-technical
users.  The upgrade process will require the modification of SQL files and MANUALLY running
SQL into your database.  If you are uncomfortable doing this, please use the INSTALL section
above and install a brand new copy of WRM 4.0 to your WebHost.  Leave your existing copy
(including database) in place (install to a new directory) so that you have your old raid
manager software available for a while to look at archived data on while using the new raid
manager to schedule new raids.

Note also, that upgrading, particularly from 3.9.9.x.x to 4.0 is an UNTESTED PROCESS.  3.6 to
4.0 has been tested and has worked a couple times on my local installations and my guild's 
information but YMMV.  All this said it SHOULD work, the upgrade is not THAT technically
difficult, though there are several steps involved in properly upgrading the database to the
new version.  

If you choose to upgrade your current installation PLEASE follow the instructions below and
do not skip steps or ASSUME you know what I'm asking you to do.  And, BACK UP YOUR DATABASE 
FIRST.  I am NOT responsible for any loss of data you experience from this.

Lastly, do not forget to shut down/disable access to WRM during this process.  It should only
take a couple minutes to get through everything but someone can SERIOUSLY bork things by 
making changes while some of this stuff is being run.  Lock the application (configuration
menu) FIRST and tell all admins NOT to be in the system while the upgrade is in progress.

* BACK UP YOUR DATABASE FIRST.
* SHUTDOWN WRM WHILE THIS PROCESS IS ACTIVE

* Unpackage the files from this archive into a directory on your local machine.

1) Select the CORRECT SQL in the install/database_schema/upgrade directory.  
	* 3.6.1_4.0.0.sql is to be used if your current database is version 3.6.1 - Production release
	* beta1_4.0.sql is to be used if you are currently running on the beta/test version of 
	WRM and need to upgrade it to 4.0.
	
2) Modify the SQL for your table prefix.
-- Search and Replace wrm_ with your particular table prefix.  You will find all tables in the
sql file start with wrm_ (wrm_raids, wrm_column_headers, etc.).  This needs to be changed to
match your CURRENT table's prefix.  At last count there should be 322 Matches within the 
SQL for the 3.6 -> 4.0 upgrade file (no clue on what is there in 4.0 beta -> 4.0 Release).

3) Run all code in "Safe Execution".
-- ***NOTE: Follow this instruction CAREFULLY***, if you add too much code at this point 
you will render all locations and raids inoperative and will have to restore your database 
or delete all raids and locations in the system and re-create them by hand.
-- In the SQL file you selected should be a header "Safe Execution" and under it should be 
ALOT of SQL code.  ALL of this is "safe" to execute and will make the lions share of changes
to your database tables and add a bunch of new tables to the system.  Once this executes your
WRM installation should go from 18 Tables to 30 Tables.

4) Modify all SQL statements in the "Manual Changes" section to meet your guilds' needs, then 
run each statement.
-- Next, find the section in the SQL file labeled "Manual Chages".  The SQL statements in this
section need/can be modified by hand BEFORE being run.  This section creates the mapping of
Class, to Talent Spec, to Role and creates the various Roles in your system.  By default this
section creates a "Tank", "Melee", "Ranged", and "Healing" role, and adds the three talent 
trees for each class (with extras for DK and Druid) and maps them to my concept of the
appropriate role for each talent spec.  This may NOT match what your guild is doing or has
already setup.  If it doesn't, change the Roles SQL to match what your guild is currently 
running and then modify the class_role SQL to map the appropriate class/talent specs to the
roles you have newly created.  Once done, run these two SQLs to populate the Role table and
the class_role table with the proper data.

5) Backup your config.php file to a separate location.
-- Copy your config.php file OUT of your current installation directory to a holding place
where it will NOT be destroyed.

6) Delete all files and Code from the base WRM directory on your Website (do not overwrite 
what's there, delete or backup and remove first).
-- Destroy everything from the WRM root directory on down.  Leave NOTHING from any prior
release in place.  The code base for WRM4 is so vastly different from that in 3.x that there
would be a serious concern of leaving any old code laying around.  DO NOT overwrite a prior
3.x release with this code.

7) Upload all new 4.0 files to the deleted area for a clean set of 4.0 code.
-- Upload the expanded archive to the newly cleaned WRM root directory (or conversely, 
just install to a completely new directory with the new code.  This would allow you to back up
to your prior installation (so long as you keep your old database copy) if significant problems
are found with 4.0).

* Change the Ownership of all files to match that of your web server.  
* Change the permissions of the following directories and files to be writable by your
	web server user:
	* config.php (see below)
	* cache/ (and all below directories)

8) Restore your config.php file to the clean WRM 4.0 Location.
-- Copy the backed up copy of config.php (step 5) back to your WRM directory.  This should now
enable WRM to re-connect to your old database without a problem.  If you choose to install
to a copy of your old WRM database (i.e. You created a seperate database for the new
installation and copied all your old data to it) then modify your config.php file to point to
the new database now.  MAKE SURE that the information in the config.php file is CORRECT for
your installation.  Particularly, make SURE that the table prefix in this file matches the
table prefix for ALL tables in your WRM installation.

9) Run install/migrate.php to migrate raid/location data to the new tables.
-- At this point you are running a custom PHP migration script that will suck the data out
of some of the existing WRM tables and re-populate that data properly into some of the new
cross reference tables.  DO NOT PROCEED ANY FARTHER TILL THIS STEP COMPLETES CORRECTLY.  
Otherwise you run the risk of borking (i.e. you WILL DESTROY) the current raid and location
data in your existing database.
 -- You should see "All Raids and Locations are now Processed. Continue by running the 
 'Data Migration Prior to Run' section" at the bottom.
-- Verify raid and location limit data through printed information on screen if necessary.

10) Run the SQL in the 'Data Migration Prior to Run' section of the upgrade SQL.
-- Go back to the upgrade SQL you have been running and page down to the "Data Migration
Prior to Run" section.  It is now safe to execute the lines/code in this section into your
database. 

11) Delete the Install directory from your server and navigate to your old URL.  Log in 
and all data should be good to go.
-- At this point you should have WRM 4.0 installed and correctly running for your system.
There is NO NEED to run through the installer application again and it would likely cause
problems if you did so.  Your application is installed, please delete the install directory
and proceed forward with running the application.
  
12) ALL PLAYERS need to go in and modify all of their characters before any draft can 
occur.  
-- Any players who do not have a primary spec properly selected will bork the signups 
for their character (they will disappear if you attempt to move them out of queue to draft 
but will take up a raid slot).  What happens is the system goes to look for the character's
primary spec to look up what role they belong to.  Since the primary spec is blank, the
character is put, literally into the "" (NULL) role, which doesn't have a view associated
with it in the raid view section...thus the player will "disappear" from the raid view and
be inaccessable through the GUI.  Raid leaders should be notified NOT to draft ANYONE who's
primary spec is not set properly (It'll show something like ":Tank" instead of 
"Protection:Tank").
-- If a player does end up in this "limbo" area, you as the system admin can fix this by 
going into the signups table, finding the character ID/Raid ID combination and setting either
the "cancelled" or "queued" flag (put a 1 in either the cancelled or queued column of the 
signup row) and the user will re-appear in the queued or cancelled area at the next reload
of the page.  

13) Raid Leaders/Admins should go into the Raids and Locations section and ensure that all 
Class and Role limits are correct.  You may simply edit those locations/raids that are NOT 
correct to correct them.
-- The limits for roles and classes for raids and locations are now pulled from cross ref 
tables in the system and not directly from the "locations" and "raids" tables anymore.  This
is the data that was "migrated" in step 9 above.  RL/RA's should look through all raids and
locations to ensure that a proper migration did in fact happen and that all of the limits
on the raids and locations are set correctly.  Click the edit button next to those that are
not correct and the system should correct itself upon update.

14) Edit configuration "Path to Header Image" to point from templates/SpiffyJr to 
templates/default.
-- When you initially load WRM after installation you will LIKELY see the header image as
incorrect (It will likely say something like "GUILD_HEADER" as a link in the upper left hand
corner of the screen).  This is just because the name of the template has changed from
"SpiffyJr" to "default".  Modify the path to header image config value in the config section
and replace the reference to "SpiffyJr" in the image path to "default" and it will show up
again.

* Note: Templates other than "default" are likely NOT to work with 4.0 for a while till the 
template editors get a chance to upgrade them.  Please switch back to default till the 
templates get updated.
* Note: You can remove the "Scripts" directory under any templates you are using, they are 
no longer used.

Installing WRM into a supported CMS system
-----------------------------------------------
At the time of this writing 4.0 supports the following CMS systems:

* e107 from http://www.e107.org
* Joomla from http://www.joomla.org (v1.5 ONLY) (NEW)
* phpBB from http://www.phpbb.com (v2 and v3)
* SMF from http://www.simplemachines.org/ (v1 and v2)
* WBB from http://www.woltlab.com/products/burning_board/index_en.php
* XOOPS from http://www.xoops.org/

Also supported, if you do not have a supported CMS system, is the "iUMS" (previously phpRaid) 
installation, which is the default non-CMS supported installation.  

If you DO intend to install this application into a CMS please note that it is a
REQUIREMENT that you install your WRM database INTO your CMS database, at the
moment you CANNOT separate the databases and have everything work.  

When entering the database information to install to, please ensure that you install
into your CMS database to get CMS integration to work.
