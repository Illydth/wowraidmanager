Quick Installation
-------------------
* Unpackage the files from this archive into a directory on your local machine.
* Open your FTP program and upload the entire contents of this archive to your web host,
	including the WRM directory.
* Change the Ownership of all files to match that of your web server.  
* Change the permissions of the following directories and files to be writable by your
	web server user:
	* config.php (see below)
	* raid_lua
* Open a web browser and go to your WRM installation (e.g. http://www.yourdomain.com/wrm)
* Choose your installation method and follow the steps to install your WoW Raid Manager server.
* At the end of the installation please remove your Install directory (delete it completely)
* Change the permissions on your config.php file back to read only to the world (you can 
	leave it writable by your web server if you so choose, but it is recommended that
	you make it read only...(444 permissions in Unix).  Keep the permissions of the other
	files and folders listed above writable.
	
Please see phpRaid_install_doc.pdf for more information.

NOTE on Config.php: Note that the config.php file no longer ships with the software.  Generally
it should be created on the fly by the installation program shipping with WRM but in some special
cases we have found that the config file is NOT created by the installation and the software has
problems when being executed.  If, after installation, you do not have a valid config.php file in 
your WRM Root Directory, please create one in the following format:

<?php
/*
#**********************************************#
#                                              #
#     auto-generated configuration file        #
#     WoW Raid Manager 3.5.0                   #
#     date: 2008-09-05 - 16:48:10              #
#   Do not change anything in this file!       #
#                                              #
#**********************************************#
*/

global $phpraid_config;
$phpraid_config['db_name'] = '<name of database>';
$phpraid_config['db_host'] = '<name of database host>';
$phpraid_config['db_user'] = '<database login user ID>';
$phpraid_config['db_pass'] = '<database login user password>';
$phpraid_config['db_prefix'] = 'wrm_'; (Change this only if you have changed the prefix in installation).
$phpraid_config['eqdkp_db_name'] = '';
$phpraid_config['eqdkp_db_host'] = '';
$phpraid_config['eqdkp_db_user'] = '';
$phpraid_config['eqdkp_db_pass'] = '';
$phpraid_config['eqdkp_db_prefix'] = '';
?>

It is safe to leave the eqdkp configuration blank for the moment.  Please see "eqdkp_link.htm" in
the docs directory for more information on linking WRM with eqdkp.

Quick Upgrade
-------------------
* Unpackage the files from this archive into a directory on your local machine.
* Open your FTP program and upload the entire contents of this archive to your web host,
	including the WRM directory.  
* MAKE SURE TO OVERWRITE ALL FILES, many FTP applications will try to resume upload by default
    and this WILL screw up the software.  Ensure that your upload of these files FORCABLY overwrites
    (replaces) the existing copy of WRM on your server.
* Change the Ownership of all files to match that of your web server.  Check the list above
	to ensure that everything listed in step 4 above is writable.  
* Run the Installation application and select "Upgrade to 3.6.1".  Follow the installer all
    the way through to the end (much of your prior information should be already set) and 
    make sure to properly re-set your authentication method (if it's not pre-selected for you).
* Note: Templates other than "default" are likely NOT to work with 4.0 for a while till the template
	editors get a chance to upgrade them.  Please switch back to default till the templates get updated.
* Note: You can remove the "Scripts" directory under any templates you are using, they are no longer used.

Installing WRM into a supported CMS system
-----------------------------------------------
At the time of this writing 3.6.0 supports the following CMS systems:

* e107 from http://www.e107.org
* Joomla from http://www.joomla.org (v1.5 ONLY) (NEW)
* phpBB from http://www.phpbb.com (v2 and v3)
* SMF from http://www.simplemachines.org/ (v1 and v2)
* WBB from http://www.woltlab.com/products/burning_board/index_en.php
* XOOPS from http://www.xoops.org/

Also supported, if you do not have a supported CMS system, is the "iUMS" (previously phpRaid) installation,
which is the default non-CMS supported installation.  

If you DO intend to install this application into a CMS please note that it is a
REQUIREMENT that you install your WRM database INTO your CMS database, at the
moment you CANNOT separate the databases and have everything work.  

When entering the database information to install to, please ensure that you install
into your CMS database to get CMS integration to work.
