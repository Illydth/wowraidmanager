Using the WOW Armory Tooltips in WOW Raid Manager:

Attribution:

The tooltip code has been shamelessly stolen from armory.deluxe-board.com from code written by Shantalya which is 
built upon overLIB, originally written and copyrighted by Erik Bosrup.  Shantalya's code was originally written 
for phpBB and has been minimally modified to work within WoW Raid Manager.  

Unfortunately, I cannot find a license or other copyright information in the body of the code or in the distribution
file anywhere.  Due to this fact, I consider this code unlicensed and thus free to use.

I have attempted to contact the developer of the original software on his/her board for more information regarding
the copyright and distribution license of this software.

Overlib is licensed from www.bosrup.com under an "Artistic" license which you can read about Here:

like the rest of my code.  Please be aware when creating derivative works of WRM that the code here may or may not

Introduction:
--------------- 
WRM supplies tooltips for two different areas: Items and Characters.

When setup correctly, both pieces will produce a popup box with information pulled down from the World of Warcraft 
armory site.  The character popup will contain information such as name, guild, talent spec, HP, Mana, + Damage, 
Attack Power, etc.  The item popup will contain information about the item such as armor value, stats, procs, etc.
The tooltips that are provided should look very much like those you would see in game.

WRM Implements the Character tooltips in code now, item tooltips are not yet used.  That said, using an item popup
is identical to using a character popup, see the "Usage:" section below for more information.

Configuration:
---------------
There is one small configuration item that is needed to begin making this work.  In the wowchar-tooltip and
wowitem-tooltip directories is a file named config.php.  There is a define in that file that sets which armory
you are pulling your information from.  Too, the Server Name and 2 Character language code needs to be set
so that the code can correctly look up the information on the armory.  These are all controlled through the 
configuration section of the WRM Application.  In the "guild configuration" section there is a box for server
and language code and a drop down for the correct armory link for your guild.  These all need to be set correctly
for the armory code to function.  FAILURE TO SET THESE VALUES TO WHAT IS RECOGNIZED BY THE ARMORY WILL CAUSE
THE ARMORY CODE TO FAIL TO FIND THE CHARACTER OR ITEM.  

Regarding the "Correct Armory Link for Server" setting in Config, Blizzard splits servers among the US servers 
and international servers in various regions.  Servers in different regions have DIFFERENT armory links where 
that servers's information is stored.  Attempting to find information for a US server on the EU Armory will
fail.  Selecting the wrong armory server for the information listed in the "Server" config box will cause all
armory lookups to return a cannot find after a significant lookup time (could be a minute or two).  
    
By default this is all setup for the main US armory (www.wowarmory.com) but could be any of:

* http://www.wowarmory.com - US Armory
* http://eu.wowarmory.com - European Union Armory (United Kingdom, France, Germany, etc.)
* http://kr.wowarmory.com - Korean Armory
* http://tw.wowarmory.com - Tiawan Armory

The configuration section will automatically set the "Define" in these files to the site which holds your guild's 
information in both the wowchar-tooltip and wowitem-tooltip directories.  The distributed config.php files will be
overwritten with the selected value every time the submit button is clicked.

To make this work, the config.php files and the cache directory under each of these two directories needs to be 
writable by the web server.  If the cache directory is not writable you will get a LONG wait time for the armory 
pull with a final message at the end saying "couldn't write to cache directory".  If the config.php files aren't
writable the application will simply not be able to change the config files based upon your selection in the 
armory link drop down in config.

Usage:
---------------
First, WRM needs to have the wowchar-tooltip and wowitem-tooltip directories in the root of the WRM Installation. 
These directories should reside in the same place as the auth, db, docs, includes, etc. directories, and should 
already be there if you are using the 3.2.1 or better version of WRM.

When the directories are in place the following needs to be added to the header.htm file in ALL APPROPIRATE INSTALLED
THEMES: (templates/default/header.htm) 

		<script type='text/javascript' language='javascript' src='wowchar-tooltip/js/overlib.js'><!-- overLIB (c) Erik Bosrup --></script>
		<script type='text/javascript' language='javascript' src='wowchar-tooltip/js/tooltipnew.js'></script>
		<script type='text/javascript' language='javascript' src='wowitem-tooltip/js/tooltipnew.js'></script>
		<link rel="stylesheet" href="wowitem-tooltip/css/tooltip.css" type="text/css" />
		<link rel="stylesheet" href="wowchar-tooltip/css/tooltip.css" type="text/css" />

This will allow the java scripts (overlib and the character and item tooltips) to be read and function on one of WRMs
pages.

Once the header has been modified, this software is available to the ENTIRE WRM SITE, any page created using the
standard methodologies in WRM (e.g. Using: "require_once('./common.php');" at the head of the PHP File) will have 
access to the tooltips through the method mentioned below.

Beyond the header then, the only thing left is to use the following methodologies to create a link to a character
or item from the appropriate armory.  

Characters:
*******************
* Method 1: The Direct Link
<!-- Character ToolTip -->
 <a href="http://{armory address}/character-sheet.xml?r={server}&n={character name}" 
     target="new" onmouseover="tooltip_charid('{server}','{language}','{character name}')" 
     onmouseout="tooltip_close_char()">{character name}</a>

Will Print: 

{character name}

Which will be a link to the armory profile for that character and have the popup.

* Method 2: JScript Code Link

 <script type="text/javascript"> if(tipcount){ tipcount = tipcount + 1; } else { var tipcount = 1 } 
 document.write("<span id=\"tip-"+tipcount+"\"></span>"); 
 sendRequst_char("{server}", "tip-"+tipcount, "{character name}", "en"); 
 </script><noscript>[{server}: {character name}]</noscript>

Will Print:

<race icon><class icon> [{server}: {character name}]

{armory address} 	- The address for the armory.  www.wowarmory.com, eu.wowarmory.com, etc.
{server} 			- The character's server name. (Alleria, etc.)
{language} 			- The language code, for US this is "en".
{character name} 	- The full name of the character as known by the armory.

NOTE: Method one will print only the character's name while method two displays the race and class icons as well as 
the character name.  Generally Method one is used in WRM.

*******************

Items:
*******************
* Method 1: Direct Link Method
 <a href="http://{armory address}/item-info.xml?i={item id}"
     target="new" onmouseover="tooltip_itemid('{item id}', '{language}')"
     onmouseout="tooltip_close()">{item name}</a>
     
Note: I can find no way to create a direct link (method 1 in characters) via an item NAME, Only an Item ID.  If you
already happen to have the item ID you can use it above to create the proper item link.

* Method 2: JScript Code Link

 <script type="text/javascript"> if(tipcount){ tipcount = tipcount + 1; } else { var tipcount = 1 } 
 document.write("<span id=\"tip-"+tipcount+"\"></span>"); sendRequst("{item}", "tip-"+tipcount, "en"); 
 </script><noscript>[{item name}]</noscript>
 
Both methods will display the same popup box with item information in it.

{armory address}	- The address for the armory.  www.wowarmory.com, eu.wowarmory.com, etc.
{item id}			- The *ID* of the item according to the armory, you CANNOT use the Item's Name in this place.
{item name}			- The name of the item, you can but should not use the ID of the item in this place.
{item}				- Can use EITHER the item name or ID in place of this value, both produce the same information.
{language}			- The language code, for US this is "en".

*******************
   
Note: Information is Cached locally.  This means that once the character or item is pulled the first time, if the armory
is not available it will STILL pop up, albeit maybe with information that is a bit older than should be.
