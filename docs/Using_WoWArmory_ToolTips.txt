Using the WOW Armory Tooltips in WOW Raid Manager:

Attribution:
---------------
The new tooltip code now comes from the phparmory.sourceforge.net website and is a full implimentation of a php
library for pulling and retrieving information from the WoW Armory.  There are many versions of the software, 

0.1 was first used in WRM 3.5.1 and was the base for pulling code from the armory.
0.2 was first used in WRM 3.6.0 and is what has been shipped ever since.  This is the last version of phpArmory
	maintained by the original Authors.
0.3 -> 0.4.2 is developed by a new developer (shiena of sourceforge - Daniel of www.marenkay.com) and is released
	under the GPLv3 license.  This is a final version of code we will be moving too in the 4.0 timeframe.
	
PHP Version
---------------
Note that as of 0.4.0 of the phparmory code, the application uses the features of PHP5 to do it's work and is NOT
backwards compatable.  I have not yet decided whether to move fully to PHP5 or whether to attempt to support PHP4
via the older version of phpArmory while allowing PHP5 users the ability to use the new features and most stable
code.

Introduction:
--------------- 
WRM supplies tooltips for two different areas: Items and Characters.

When setup correctly, both pieces will produce a popup box with information pulled down from the World of Warcraft 
armory site.  The character popup will contain information such as name, guild, talent spec, HP, Mana, + Damage, 
Attack Power, etc.  The item popup will contain information about the item such as armor value, stats, procs, etc.
The tooltips that are provided should look very much like those you would see in game.

WRM Implements the Character tooltips in code now, item tooltips are not yet used.  That said, using an item popup
is identical to using a character popup, see the "Usage:" section below for more information.

Configuration:
---------------
To configure the phpArmory code for use, a site admin must go into the configruation section of WRM and modify 
the guild information section.  The most important information is the dropdown of which wow armory website the
guild's data will come from.  Too, the "Name" and "Server" must be exact as it is these strings that are used
by the lookup code to submit the proper query to the armory website.

FAILURE TO SET THESE VALUES TO WHAT IS RECOGNIZED BY THE ARMORY WILL CAUSE THE ARMORY CODE TO FAIL TO FIND THE 
CHARACTER OR ITEM.  

Regarding the "Correct Armory Link for Server" setting in Config, Blizzard splits servers among the US servers 
and international servers in various regions.  Servers in different regions have DIFFERENT armory links where 
that servers's information is stored.  Attempting to find information for a US server on the EU Armory will
fail.  Selecting the wrong armory server for the information listed in the "Server" config box will cause all
armory lookups to return a cannot find after a significant lookup time (could be a minute or two).  
    
By default this is all setup for the main US armory (www.wowarmory.com) but could be any of:

* http://www.wowarmory.com - US Armory
* http://eu.wowarmory.com - European Union Armory (United Kingdom, France, Germany, etc.)
* http://kr.wowarmory.com - Korean Armory
* http://tw.wowarmory.com - Tiawan Armory

Usage:
---------------
First, WRM needs to have the wowarmory directory in the includes direcotry of the WRM Installation (ships this way
by default).  

When the directories are in place the following needs to be added to the header.htm file in ALL APPROPIRATE INSTALLED
THEMES: (templates/default/header.htm) 

		<script language="JavaScript" src="includes/wowarmory/js/qtip.js" type="text/JavaScript"></script>
		<script language="JavaScript" src="includes/wowarmory/js/tw-sack.js" type="text/JavaScript"></script>
		<script language="JavaScript" src="includes/wowarmory/js/ajax-dynamic-content.js" type="text/JavaScript"></script>		
		<link rel="stylesheet" href="includes/wowarmory/style.php" type="text/css" title="wow">

This will allow the java scripts (the character and item tooltips) to be read and function on one of WRMs
pages.

Once the header has been modified, this software is available to the ENTIRE WRM SITE, any page created using the
standard methodologies in WRM (e.g. Using: "require_once('./common.php');" at the head of the PHP File) will have 
access to the tooltips through the method mentioned below.

From there, there are two files in the root of the wowarmory directory: char.php and item.php that control the actual
retrieval of information from the armory.

To get character data you would call the function "get_armorychar()" passing it the character name, language, and 
server.  The proper armory link will be pulled from the configuration section.

A function to retrieve item data is not yet written, but will essentially be similar to get_armorychar() (likely
get_armoryitem()) that would allow for the retrieval of item data from the armory.


*******************
   
Note: At the moment information is NOT Cached locally.  Once Caching is truned on (sometime in the 4.0 timeframe) 
this will mean that once the character or item is pulled the first time, if the armory is not available it will 
STILL pop up, albeit maybe with information that is a bit older than should be.
