Release of 4.0.0 Final of WoW Raid Manager
-----------------------------------
-- 4.0 Beta 1 Changes.
* Table Views and Column Changes
The largest thing that any user will experience with this new version of the software is 
that all tables (like the raid list, roster, users list, etc.) in the output are now 
generated a different way.  We are no longer using the underlaying reports.php file and 
this, along with the Smarty Templating system's power, has allowed me to do some things 
with the table views we weren't able to before.

First and foremost is the number of records per page / pagination.  There is now a config 
option in the config table for Number of Records per page.  If you want to limit the number 
of records displayed on tables to 10 instead of the prior 25 you can now do so.  Keep in 
mind that there is no "UI" surrounding changing this at the moment.  You will need to go 
into your config table and find the "records_per_page" config value.  It should be set to 
25 by default.  Change that to any vaule you'd like and make sure it all works.  I have been 
playing with 4 as a default number during my testing to ensure jump tables and the rest of 
the pagination stuff works.

Next, the columns in each table view are now configurable as to whether they are shown or 
not shown, and adding new columns to a table is more "dynamic" (though will still require 
data values to be added to the code).  There is a new database table included with this 
version called "column_headers" and it contains a record for each column in each view (view 
information listed below).  Don't want to see the arcane resistance value for a drafted 
member of the raid anymore?  No problem, turn the column visibility flag in the database off 
for that specific view and arcane will magically dissappear at the next page reload. 

Again, there is no UI associated with this at the moment (again there will be), so you will 
have to manually modify the visible flag for each column in the database manually...but this 
should be a hell of alot easier than having to go into the code and manually comment out add 
column lines to hide a column, and will allow admins to get the look they want out of their 
tables without having to suffer with default views.

* Adding More Data to Each Table Output
At the moment, ALL FIELDS for ALL TABLES are turned on.  What you see in each table 
represents the MAXIMUM amount of information each table can display.  If you do not see a 
column now, that column is not available to be shown in the view. 

One thing I'm looking for is suggestions for what can/should be ADDED to each of the view 
sets to allow more information to be shown in the various tables.  The focus by most users 
has always been removing data they don't want to see, but I also want to make sure that any 
piece of information the user could possibly need on a given table in WRM COULD be displayed 
if they so wanted it (Within reason).  As you are going through the software please keep in 
the back of your mind the question "Could more data be added to this table to make it more 
useful?"

* Separating / Combining Table Outputs
By and large, almost every table view in 3.6 of WRM has been separated in to it's own "view" 
in the column_headers table.  As you are going through the application if you find places 
where two tables are based off of the same view and you'd like them separated, or if you 
find places where you really think the two views should be consolidated, please feel free to 
comment.

* Default Column Visibility
Along this same lines, if you feel any specific fields in the output should, by default, be 
turned off (remember they're ALL on right now), I would be willing to hear your comments on 
this as well.

* Smarty Template System
As I've hinted at and stated many many times we are now using the smarty templating system 
(http://www.smarty.net) as our templating system backend.  One of the benefits this system 
provides is the ability to turn on and off debugging information for each page load.  This 
will assist with displaying page variables and their values and give me some idea when 
something goes wrong as to what might be an issue.  The smarty debugging symbols are ON BY 
DEFAULT in this and all future sets of beta code.  I would request that if at all possible 
you leave this debugging information on while you are testing the application so that we can 
get information on what might be going wrong.  That said, if you have non-techical users 
using this beta software, especially if you opt to use this as your guild's major 
installation, there's a high likelyhood that the debug box that pops up on page load will at 
minimum get very annoying and at most scare the [censored] out of your users.

This can be turned off by opening the common.php file (from your WRM Root directory) and 
look down around lines 135.  You will see a comment noting turning on and off Debugging.  
Please Uncomment the debugging false and comment the debugging true.  DO NOT DELETE THE TRUE 
LINE COMMENT IT ONLY.  This way, when I ask you to turn debugging back on to solve an issue, 
you won't have to ask "how do I do that?"

Consider this annoyance my guarantee that all of my beta testers read this message, and grin 
to yourself every time you see a "how the hell do I turn that [censored] popup window off" 
secure in the knowledge that that person didn't read this message. :)

The second item of interest are on lines 133 and 134.  Note that Smarty has the abilty to 
cache it's templates for faster reload from disk.  HOWEVER any template that is cached 
doesn't seem to re-generate itself unless the page itself changes, NOT JUST THE PAGE DATA.  
In other words, adding a new raid to the system will cause the page to simply reload from 
cache and will not flag the page as changed, thus the new raid won't show up.

I have a couple ideas on a way to implement a cache mangement system for WRM, but if anyone 
out there in the community has experience developing applications using smarty and has a 
thought out plan for how to implement a cache system I would be deeply appreciative of 
hearing about it.  Please start a new thread and let me know your ideas.

-- 4.0 Beta 2
* Table / Datastructure Reorganization - Massive reorganization of the table/data structure
model release allows most of the system now to be database driven.  Classes, Races, Roles, 
and all of the rest of this inherent data is now compiled and configured in the database.  
This leaves the system open for expansion to other games much more easily than it was before.
It also allows for some VERY cool functionality to be added based up on class, subclass
(talent spec) and role.

* phpArmory 0.4.2 Implemented, Cached Data implemented.  A new version of the armory pull
software has been added to the system.  This version however is php5 compatable ONLY, php4
folks will miss out on all of these new features, but the old phpArmory system is still in 
place so all prior functionality should (for the moment) work without a hitch.  There is a 
new configuration item allowing caching to database, file or no caching.

* Role Changes.  A new table (wrm_roles) has been added to the system allowing roles to be 
table configured instead of just hard coded.  This allows more than the 6 default roles to 
be added.  Simply add a role to the roles table with a sequential role ID (role7 is the next
ID to use) and in the lang_index field add the lang file index name for the role text (If you
have $phprlang['configuration_role5_text'] = "Role 5"; then "configuration_role5_text" is the
lang_index).  The configuration section will now update and modify the roles table, the
role1_text-role6_text configuration items in the config table are now extranious.

phpRaid_data.lua file Update
-------------------------------

Template Changes
-------------------------------
These are simply too numerious to list.  The ENTIRE set of templates has been re-written using
the smarty template system.  There is NO prior template that will work with this version at 
all.  Make sure to reset back to what is now called "default" to make things work.

Unfinished/Incomplete
----------------------
* Starting Day is set inside the calendar file, not as a dropdown in configuration.  To change the "first"
day of the week, you need to modify the calendar.  On line 100, change the word "Sunday" to the localized
name of the day of the week to start on (the only two supported days are "Sunday" and "Monday" at the
moment.)
* CMS Bridges supporting password changing should not be a variable in the bridge but should be a
configuration option.  At this point, however, to turn on password changes for bridges you will need to
modify the <wrm_base_dir>/auth/*.php file related to the bridge you have installed.
