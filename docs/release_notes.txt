Fast Note: There is ALOT of information in this release note for 3.6.1 since there has been a
full set of changes implmented since 3.6.0, please browse through at least the 3.6.1 section of 
these notes for important information regarding 3.6.1, the 3.6.0 sections also have some 
important information for people upgrading to 3.6.0 who have not already applied any of the
3.6.0.x patches.

Release of 3.6.1 Final of WoW Raid Manager
-----------------------------------
3.6.1 is identical to v3.6.0.2 + Patch except for the addition of an additional feature.  

This update encorporates all "consolidated" patches for 3.6.0 and adds a new feature to the
calendar.

* Calendar Icons now supported: Instead of the text based calendar I developed for 3.6.0 we
have a new icon based calendar.  Each raid will now appear as an event specific ICON (assuming
it is setup, see below) on the calendar with a mouseover denoting the raid, invite and start
times as well as description.  As with the text link, clicking on the icon will take you to the
raid to allow you to sign up.   

* Location System Rewrite: Along with the calendar icon addition, the locations section has
received a MAJOR overhaul.  It now supports and understands all Blizzard Raid and Dungeon zones
inherently, including Max Raid/Group size, Icon, and the Game Calendar based raid name.  Creating
a new location is now as easy as selecting the Type (Raid, Dungeon, PvP, Meeting, Other), Expansion 
(Generic, BC, or Wrath) and then the selecting the zone from the dropdown, relivant information 
will be filled in for you and the event Icon will be immediately set for the event to appear in 
the calendar.  See "Calendar Icons and Location Changes" below for more detailed information.

Calendar Icons and Location Changes
------------------------------------
As noted in the release announcement, the locations section has been re-written to support
attaching icons to raid events.  

There is now a new set of database tables (events, event_type and expansion) included that
assist with the support of managing Blizzard's game information.  The events table now includes a
listing of all blizzard raid and dungeon instances in the game, including generic, BC and WotLK
released instances.  This is now the basis for creating a new location.  In the locations section
the location creator will now select from dropdowns the basic zone and information that the location
will be based upon.  Once that base information is filled in the location maintainer will be able
to set or re-set most of the location inforamation (like class and level limits) as well as give
the location a unique identifier.

Note that this is a LARGE change from the fairly open location design in the past but all possible
configurations should be accounted for.  If you find that you are missing an "event" of some kind
that your guild regularly uses, you can add it to the events table by simply adding a record.  If 
you find a major event missing, please let me know and I will try to add it in the future.

NOTE:  All CURRENTLY CREATED LOCATIONS will need to be updated in your software to support the new
raid icons and to link them with proper events.  This SHOULD be as easy as going into the locations
section of your WRM installation and doing an "edit" on each location and selecting the correct zone
that that location applies to.  Note that any locations not updated in this way will get a "generic"
icon on the WRM calendar.

****  3.6.0, 3.6.0.1, and 3.6.0.2 Release Notes  ***
****************************************************
****************************************************
The original 3.6.0 Release Announcement and the 3.6.0.1 and 3.6.0.2 announcements have been
maintained below to get a full picture of the 3.6.x release version.

=========================================
   *** 3.6.0.2 Release Information ***
=========================================

The 3.6.0.2 Release announcement is as follows:
------------------------------------------------
This patch represents a set of combined patches and various bugfixes to the 3.6.0 software.

Installation instructions for this patch are contained within the .zip or .tar.gz file in the README.txt file.

PLEASE READ THIS FILE

There is a database update that needs done and instructions on how to apply the database update (it will require you to possibly minorly modify the SQL file).

Note: This patch ONLY applies to 3.6.0/3.6.0.1.  DO NOT attempt to apply this patch to any other release of software besides a 3.6.0.x installation of WRM.

If you are having problems with any other version of WRM, please upgrade to 3.6.0 first before identifying issues.

Quick and Dirty Upgrade Instructions
------------------------------------------------------------------
Download the .zip or .tar.gz file.
Upload the files in the cp2 directory to your WRM root on your webserver OVERWRITE ALL FILES.
Read the README.txt file for instructions on how to modify the wrm3602.sql file in the wrm360_cp2 directory.
Execute the wrm3602.sql file to your database.

You should be all patched.

Quick and Dirty New Install Instructions
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Download the 3.6.0 base package.
Unzip to a local directory.
Download the 3.6.0.1 upgrade package.
Unzip to a local directory.
Download the 3.6.0.2 upgrade package.
Unzip to a local directory.
Copy all 3.6.0.1 files over the top of all 3.6.0 files.
Copy all the 3.6.0.2 files over the top of all 3.6.0 files.
Upload the entire 3.6.0 directory (which should now include the 3.6.0.1 and 3.6.0.2 upgrade files) to a directory on your webserver.
Run the installer.

Versions Prior to 3.6.0:
---------------------------
While versions prior to 3.6.0 are not supported, the security breach DOES affect these versions of the software.  Again, while there is no support for v3.5.x and before it is likely that these auth files will work for prior versions of the WRM software.  While I cannot gaurentee total compatibility, it is likely that unzipping the 3.6.0.2 consolidated patch and overwriting the auth and includes files (DO NOT modify the installer or installation files in the install directories for these versions) for versions at least as far back as 3.5.0 and potentially back to the 3.2 versions will work to update and fix the securty problems inherent in these bridges.

ADMINS ARE ON THEIR OWN if they choose to implement these patch files on versions prior to 3.6.0/3.6.0.1.  I recommend keeping backup copies of the "working" bridges before attempting to overwrite them with the files from 3.6.0.2.
----------------------------------------------------

3.6.0.2 Change Notes:
---------------------
Release Notes
-------------------
* SECURITY FIX: This release fixes a major security hole in the WRM application
where the user password is stored in plain text in a cookie accessible to the en
tire domain.  User passwords were easily readable by viewing the cookies associa
ted with connecting to the WRM application.  Using man in the middle attacks or
other methods of obtaining cookies sent to a domain, a hacker could obtain passw
ord information for a user using WRM.  In the case of a bridged installation thi
s password would compromise both WRM's security as well as the security of the b
ridged application.

* SECURITY FIX: This release fixes a medium/major security hole allowing users of one WRM installation on a domain to freely log in/access/manage another WRM installation on the same domain.  Given two WRM/phpRaid installations on the sameweb host (say under the directories /wrm and /wrm2) the users of WRM2, once logged in to WRM2, would ALSO have access to the same ProfileID (possible for a different user name) in the WRM1 installation.  Due to the way session data is stored on the system, the session cookie for users using WRM2 would also load when using WRM1 (or visa versa), however due to another bug, the user login data is not checked once this sesssion was loaded, causing users to obtain access to the WRM1 installation as the profile ID they are logged in under the WRM2 installation (again, or visa versa).

NOTE: If you have followed the security fix on the WRM boards for this problem (making user cookies expire immediately when the browser window exits) this fix will restore the functionality of allowing users to stay logged in for 30 days before having to log in again, however this time it is a secure method of cookie storage.  Please DO NOT apply the security fix from the WRM post to this installation once you have upgraded to 3.6.0.2.

Session Security Information
----------------------------
As a new "feature" (read now that it's written properly), WRM has double session protection.  First, each bridge uses a different session name, and these session names should be "Unique" amoung web applications.  Thus, a WRM installation using the iUMS bridge and one using the e107 bridge can never cross sessions, regardless of their installations, due to the session names being different.  Secondly, the session cookie is now stored in the web path of the WRM installation instead of at the web host root.  This means that even if two WRM installations ofthe same Type (same bridge usage: e.g. an iUMS and an iUMS installation) are installed on the same server, so long as they're not installed in the same web path (which is impossible without using symbolic links) will never share the same session information due to the web path for each installation being different.

With these changes it should be completely safe to have multiple copies of WRM running on any given web host.

=========================================
   *** 3.6.0 Release Information ***
=========================================
3.6.0 Release Notes:
----------------------
* Addition of a .htaccess file in the WRM root directory to turn on proper error logging for
the WRM site.  If users have problems with this or if this interfears with a current .htaccess
file it is OK to turn off/modify/remove this .htaccess file, with the caveaut that they may
have problems with error reporting.

* This is a 3.5.1 fix that got merged to 3.6.0.  "Sanity Checking" of the config.php file.
The sanity checker looks for some "badness" in the config files and stops the use of WRM if
it finds any.  This should help protect against certain types of web based attacks.

* Open Basedir Fix (again 3.5.1 -> 3.6.0 Merge).  PLEASE READ THE SECTION BELOW FOR
INFORMATION ON THE OPEN BASEDIR VS SET INI ISSUES!!!  See: "Damned if you do, damned if you
don't Issue" below.

* Installation Update: The Joomla installation now properly reports "Joomla" installation
instead of a phpBB installation...the Joomla installer has received counciling and is doing
much better with it's schitzophrenia.  It just needs to stay on it's medication and it'll be
fine...

* Added Swedish Language for both Installation and Use.

* PHPBB3 Bridge Fix: Fixed password/login issue allowing access to unauthorized users.

* German Language updated for better/more current text in both installation and usage language
files.

* Death Knights added: Death Knights should now be fully supported by WRM.  Create them as
any other character through the profile section of WRM.  They will properly show up on both
raid and class views as well as in the tables where other class information shows.

* Fix for Role Limit checking, invalid variable name caused limits to be ignored.

* UTF-8 Character set update.  An ongoing struggle to get WRM to support Multi-byte characters
from the UTF-8 character set is still ongoing.  While not "fixed" this should hopefully make
things 'better'.

* Major Update to the phpRaid_output.lua file produced through the Lua output raids link.  
Please see information below for information on the output file.

* Added Event Type to raid and location templates to assist in syncronizing data with the 
in game blizzard calendar.

* Minor HTML updates in wowarmory_tooltip area to fix minor HTML Incompatibilities.  

* Bug Fix: Users in permissions sets not showing up when viewed by clicking link from
users.php.  The link had a bad parameter in it, this is now fixed.

* Calendar Fix: A varible misuse in calendar file caused all signups to show as "queued but not
signed up", has been fixed.  The correct mark should now show up properly next to a raid 
event on the calendar when a user is signed up to the event.

* Announcements Bug Fix: Announcements will now properly recognize a "return" character in
the type in box and translate that to <br> for you.  There is no longer a need to use 
<br> at the end of each line in the announcement to show multi-line announcmenents properly.
Or beter put, the Announcements box is more "WYSIWYG".

* Bug Fix: Hacking Attempt in rss.php is fixed.  More use of "&amp;" in a header instead of
the proper & use.

* View.php Comment Popups Fixed...hopefully for the last time.  Users were having two issues
with comment popups in view.php: 1) Comments for "drafted" users simply weren't showing at all
and 2) Comments for Queued and Cancelled users were popping up only till a user moused over
an armory popup link, then they stopped popping up till page refresh.  This is now fixed.  
All view.php comments will properly pop up regardless of what status you are and they work 
with the armory popups again.

* Installation Bug Fix/Security Fix: Installation into windows based machines was failing if the user tried
to use "\" to specify path structure to other files (for instance when trying to specify the
path to the config.php file of phpbb3 if the user were to type in, for instance "C:\Junk" they
would get an error from the MySQL database.  Installation type ins were not being properly
escaped and quoted.  They are now.

* Level 80 Configuration Supported.  Max level for WRM is now set to 80.  This is still a 
hard coded string but will not be beyond 4.0.


"Damned if you do, damned if you don't Issue" (Open Basedir vs. Set INI)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
At the beginning of this version a couple users reported a problem with including files
within WRM.  When the WRM common.php file went to include the various functions needed by 
the application to run they had issues with their PHP Server throwing back problems at them
identifying that a specific php.ini setting was set that removed the ability to include files
that were not on the "include path" set by PHP.  This "open basedir" issue resulted in me
putting in a fix that included a "set_ini" parameter update to put the various WRM directories
into the PHP include path, thus allowing those affected by the open basedir issue to work.

HOWEVER nothing can be easy.  In doing so I opened up another segment of users to problems:
specificaly those whose host does not allow modification of the php.ini variables on the fly
(they have "set_ini" restricted).  At this point the application is NOT written to support
both kinds of users.  I suppose it would be simple enough to check the open_basedir parameter
and run the "set_ini" stuff if it's set, however this is NOT done.  And if anyone has a better
way to handle this please let me know.

As it sits, the application is default configured to correct the Open Basedir problem as more
people have issues with this than the set_ini issues.  For those of you who are affected by
the SET_INI issue, you can comment out a couple sections of code in 2 files and you will be
working again.

In the common.php file (wrm base directory), you will find lines 58-62 and lines 114-116 need
commented to remove the SET INI problems.  Also in wowarmory_tooltip/includes/common.php lines
24-30 need commented.  This should remove all the "open basedir" fix stuff and allow the 
set ini problems to go away.

If you are on a host that restricts both open_basedir and set_ini you're hosed...find a better
host amoung the 10s of thousands out there...or ask your host what the hell they're thinking, 
and why they're so inconsiderate to me...yes, me personally. :)


phpRaid_data.lua file Update
-------------------------------
For those of you who export/import your raids and use a raid manager UI mod (Like RIM) there
have been some MAJOR changes to the output LUA file.  Unfortunately this likely means that 
RIM is now "broken" till the next update by Elayne...I don't know if the file will load up
in her current released version or not.  HOWEVER all the changes bring about some love for
RIM's users.  More data is being passed down and we may have the UTF-8 Issue with RIM either
fixed or at least better.  Also, RIM is now positioned to support the in game calendar to 
import WRM data to RIM and RIM then imports that data to the Calendar.  This should allow 
users to see WRM scheduled raids on their personal in game calendars.

Keep in mind that RIM is still a work in progress and is supported on the wowraidmanager.net
forums by Elayne in the RIM specific support forums.  Please check out the mod it's great.


Unfinished/Incomplete
----------------------
* Starting Day is set inside the calendar file, not as a dropdown in configuration.  To change the "first"
day of the week, you need to modify the calendar.  On line 100, change the word "Sunday" to the localized
name of the day of the week to start on (the only two supported days are "Sunday" and "Monday" at the
moment.)
* CMS Bridges supporting password changing should not be a variable in the bridge but should be a
configuration option.  At this point, however, to turn on password changes for bridges you will need to
modify the <wrm_base_dir>/auth/*.php file related to the bridge you have installed.
