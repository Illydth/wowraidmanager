Release of 3.6.0 Final of WoW Raid Manager
-----------------------------------
* Addition of a .htaccess file in the WRM root directory to turn on proper error logging for
the WRM site.  If users have problems with this or if this interfears with a current .htaccess
file it is OK to turn off/modify/remove this .htaccess file, with the caveaut that they may
have problems with error reporting.

* This is a 3.5.1 fix that got merged to 3.6.0.  "Sanity Checking" of the config.php file.
The sanity checker looks for some "badness" in the config files and stops the use of WRM if
it finds any.  This should help protect against certain types of web based attacks.

* Open Basedir Fix (again 3.5.1 -> 3.6.0 Merge).  PLEASE READ THE SECTION BELOW FOR
INFORMATION ON THE OPEN BASEDIR VS SET INI ISSUES!!!  See: "Damned if you do, damned if you
don't Issue" below.

* Installation Update: The Joomla installation now properly reports "Joomla" installation
instead of a phpBB installation...the Joomla installer has received counciling and is doing
much better with it's schitzophrenia.  It just needs to stay on it's medication and it'll be
fine...

* Added Swedish Language for both Installation and Use.

* PHPBB3 Bridge Fix: Fixed password/login issue allowing access to unauthorized users.

* German Language updated for better/more current text in both installation and usage language
files.

* Death Knights added: Death Knights should now be fully supported by WRM.  Create them as
any other character through the profile section of WRM.  They will properly show up on both
raid and class views as well as in the tables where other class information shows.

* Fix for Role Limit checking, invalid variable name caused limits to be ignored.

* UTF-8 Character set update.  An ongoing struggle to get WRM to support Multi-byte characters
from the UTF-8 character set is still ongoing.  While not "fixed" this should hopefully make
things 'better'.

* Major Update to the phpRaid_output.lua file produced through the Lua output raids link.  
Please see information below for information on the output file.

* Added Event Type to raid and location templates to assist in syncronizing data with the 
in game blizzard calendar.

* Minor HTML updates in wowarmory_tooltip area to fix minor HTML Incompatibilities.  

* Bug Fix: Users in permissions sets not showing up when viewed by clicking link from
users.php.  The link had a bad parameter in it, this is now fixed.

* Calendar Fix: A varible misuse in calendar file caused all signups to show as "queued but not
signed up", has been fixed.  The correct mark should now show up properly next to a raid 
event on the calendar when a user is signed up to the event.

* Announcements Bug Fix: Announcements will now properly recognize a "return" character in
the type in box and translate that to <br> for you.  There is no longer a need to use 
<br> at the end of each line in the announcement to show multi-line announcmenents properly.
Or beter put, the Announcements box is more "WYSIWYG".

* Bug Fix: Hacking Attempt in rss.php is fixed.  More use of "&amp;" in a header instead of
the proper & use.

* View.php Comment Popups Fixed...hopefully for the last time.  Users were having two issues
with comment popups in view.php: 1) Comments for "drafted" users simply weren't showing at all
and 2) Comments for Queued and Cancelled users were popping up only till a user moused over
an armory popup link, then they stopped popping up till page refresh.  This is now fixed.  
All view.php comments will properly pop up regardless of what status you are and they work 
with the armory popups again.

* Installation Bug Fix/Security Fix: Installation into windows based machines was failing if the user tried
to use "\" to specify path structure to other files (for instance when trying to specify the
path to the config.php file of phpbb3 if the user were to type in, for instance "C:\Junk" they
would get an error from the MySQL database.  Installation type ins were not being properly
escaped and quoted.  They are now.

* Level 80 Configuration Supported.  Max level for WRM is now set to 80.  This is still a 
hard coded string but will not be beyond 4.0.


"Damned if you do, damned if you don't Issue" (Open Basedir vs. Set INI)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
At the beginning of this version a couple users reported a problem with including files
within WRM.  When the WRM common.php file went to include the various functions needed by 
the application to run they had issues with their PHP Server throwing back problems at them
identifying that a specific php.ini setting was set that removed the ability to include files
that were not on the "include path" set by PHP.  This "open basedir" issue resulted in me
putting in a fix that included a "set_ini" parameter update to put the various WRM directories
into the PHP include path, thus allowing those affected by the open basedir issue to work.

HOWEVER nothing can be easy.  In doing so I opened up another segment of users to problems:
specificaly those whose host does not allow modification of the php.ini variables on the fly
(they have "set_ini" restricted).  At this point the application is NOT written to support
both kinds of users.  I suppose it would be simple enough to check the open_basedir parameter
and run the "set_ini" stuff if it's set, however this is NOT done.  And if anyone has a better
way to handle this please let me know.

As it sits, the application is default configured to correct the Open Basedir problem as more
people have issues with this than the set_ini issues.  For those of you who are affected by
the SET_INI issue, you can comment out a couple sections of code in 2 files and you will be
working again.

In the common.php file (wrm base directory), you will find lines 58-62 and lines 114-116 need
commented to remove the SET INI problems.  Also in wowarmory_tooltip/includes/common.php lines
24-30 need commented.  This should remove all the "open basedir" fix stuff and allow the 
set ini problems to go away.

If you are on a host that restricts both open_basedir and set_ini you're hosed...find a better
host amoung the 10s of thousands out there...or ask your host what the hell they're thinking, 
and why they're so inconsiderate to me...yes, me personally. :)


phpRaid_data.lua file Update
-------------------------------
For those of you who export/import your raids and use a raid manager UI mod (Like RIM) there
have been some MAJOR changes to the output LUA file.  Unfortunately this likely means that 
RIM is now "broken" till the next update by Elayne...I don't know if the file will load up
in her current released version or not.  HOWEVER all the changes bring about some love for
RIM's users.  More data is being passed down and we may have the UTF-8 Issue with RIM either
fixed or at least better.  Also, RIM is now positioned to support the in game calendar to 
import WRM data to RIM and RIM then imports that data to the Calendar.  This should allow 
users to see WRM scheduled raids on their personal in game calendars.

Keep in mind that RIM is still a work in progress and is supported on the wowraidmanager.net
forums by Elayne in the RIM specific support forums.  Please check out the mod it's great.


Unfinished/Incomplete
----------------------
* Starting Day is set inside the calendar file, not as a dropdown in configuration.  To change the "first"
day of the week, you need to modify the calendar.  On line 100, change the word "Sunday" to the localized
name of the day of the week to start on (the only two supported days are "Sunday" and "Monday" at the
moment.)
* CMS Bridges supporting password changing should not be a variable in the bridge but should be a
configuration option.  At this point, however, to turn on password changes for bridges you will need to
modify the <wrm_base_dir>/auth/*.php file related to the bridge you have installed.
