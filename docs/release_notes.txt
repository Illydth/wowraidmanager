Release 3.1.0 of phpRaid.
----------------------------
phpRaid has new "management".  As phpRaider from SpiffyJr had replaced phpRaid
as the raid scheduling system he was putting his time into, the phpRaid code
was considered dead.  Since phpRaid still has an online community, and since
the code for phpRaid was accessable at the time of this writing, I have decided 
to carry it along.

This update contains some basic changes that make it more functional for my
guild.  Where appropriate i've tried to include options to get the system to 
work as it always has in the past.  In the few instances where i've changed 
functionality to make it different from the 3.0.9.2 system I have tried to 
document those areas, both in code as well as here in the notes.

If there are changes that have made the system unliveable to the users for your 
specific guild please let me know and i'll be happy to try to get a release out
that manages those areas better.  The intent of 3.1.0 is as a drop in replacement
update of all prior versions of code, not as a system written specifically for
my needs or a handfull of guilds.

Modifications for 3.1.0 are listed below:
-------------------------------------
* New Extensible Authentication System.  While writing new authentication modules
is still a codeing project, the concepts behind writing a module to link in with
another system have been made easier.  There are now 4 functions that need to be
written to install a new authentication system.  There is no need to touch any
of the base phpRaid code to add a new system to authenticate against.  See
authenticating_against_new_cms.txt in the docs directory for more information.

* Support for the e107 CMS system.  e107 is now a natively supported system for 
user authentication.  Please see the documentation in the install/auth/
directory in the install_e107.php file.  This is in addition to the phpBB and
phpRaid authentication that already existed.

* Support for three distinct classes of users.  Raid Administrators (those with
the raids permission set in the permissions area), Raid Leaders (the user who
started and thus owns a raid, displayed as "Leader" (used to be officer) on the
raid list, and "Users", those people signing up for a raid who are not Admins 
or the RL.  This change allows those with "Raids" permissions to be granted
enhanced permissions for raid signups or to administrate multiple raids at once.
This change helps support the phpRaid system being used for 5 man group signup
as well.

* Group Support.  phpRaid has been changed at a fundamental level to support
being used as a signup system for 5 man groups as well as raids.  Please see
the online documentation "enable_groups.htm" in the docs folder for more
information, you can access this documentation through the "help" link on the
phpRaid configuration page under the "Enable Groups" checkbox.

* New more easily modified user signup flow.  For those guilds who have a
slightly different process for signing up users for their raids, the phpRaid
system now supports an easier method of changing what buttons users have access
to.  In the "signup_flow.php" file are 3 functions, one controls user access
when they're in the queue, one controls access when they're in the "signed up"
area, and one controls the access for users in the cancelled area.  Simply 
turning on and off buttons in the documented "if" statements will change the
process flow to allow more or less access or even completely changed process 
flows.  

Note: this is a temporary solution till I can get a fully functional
configuration based system up and running for this.  Look for it in the next
version of the software.

Note: The default signup flow (what buttons users have access to) may have 
changed in this version.  If you are finding that your users aren't able
to do things they're used to doing, or can do more than they should, you 
can easily edit signup_flow.php (read the comments) to modify the behavior.

* Granularity for time dropdowns (Signup Time, Raid Time, etc.) has been changed
to 15 minute intervals.  Users will no longer be able to schedule a raid for 
8:07 pm with a signup time of 7:32 pm.  Instead your "Minute" options are: 00,
15,30,45.  While this is a basic change to the system, I simply don't see the
need to populate the dropdown with (and thus force people to scroll through) 60 
options when 4 is really sufficient.  I could be convinced to go to 10 minute
granularity instead of 15, but really i've never encounterd a guild that is so
punctual as to be able to make an 8:05 raid start time as opposed to 8:06.

* To support the 3 levels of raid access introduced in 3.1.0 (see above) and 
the 5 man group support added for phpRaid in this version, the name "officer"
in the header of the raids listing has been changed to "Leader", the underlaying
database and code has NOT been changed to reflect the new name, only the display.

Fixes for 3.1.0
-----------------
* Locations with a ' in them (For instance "Gruul's Lair" or "Onyxia's Lair"
were failing to load properly when creating new raids or editing raids.  The 
problem with the underlaying java code is now fixed.

* Install addendum.txt file mistakenly named "Install addendum..txt" (two dots)
this has been renamed.
