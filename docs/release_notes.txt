Release of 3.5.1 of WoW Raid Manager
-----------------------------------
At least a few new changes to WRM since 3.5.0.  As always, this release supercedes any prior release of WRM.

First and foremost, we have "staffing" changes:

* Neme has been added as an official developer with a focus on the Installation and Bridge files.
* TheMuffinMan has been added as an official developer and front end guy with focus on the Java source
	as well as general overall html/php code health (one of the major "behind the scenes changes in this
	release is that the vast majority of the code is now HTML 4.0 Compliant thanks to the work of Muffin).
* JonnyB was recruited for the "Look and Feel" part of WRM, he's an HTML/Graphics Designer with a focus
	on the templates, Themes, Layout, CSS, etc. behind WRM.  You'll see alot more of his work over the 
	comming releases.
	
As always this isn't a full list of everyone responsible for the code that's gone into WRM this version.
Many of you have helped, either in reporting bugs, testing the software, or in actually writing and 
contributing code fixes, my hats off to all of you.

Secondly, there are several additions to the software itself:

* The Calendar View has been COMPLETELY re-written.  The calendar now supports looking ahead month by
	month, month selection (jump to any specific month within the current or next year), and other more 
	minor features.  Possibly the most important: All of the HTML has been removed and pushed into a 
	template file for better themeing.  The look may be the same, but the functionality is greatly
	enhanced. 

* Brand New Armory Lookup Code.  I've replaced the armory lookup system with a brand new system.  There
	are some goods and bads to this.  The good side is it's ALOT less complicated, and it will likely
	work on more systems than it used to.  The down side is alot of the caching mechanisms are gone: 
	thus if the armory happens to be down there's not much you can do to get an armory lookup.  I also
	liked the look and feel of the old armory system better than I do this one, but this one generates
	MUCH more clean HTML code.  I welcome any feedback on the new armory lookup system.
	
* View by Role or View by Class.  The Raid View has been changed to allow for two different views, 
	depending upon which is more helpful to the guild using it.  There is a new configuration option
	"Select Raid View Type" that will allow a display by class or by role in the raid view window.
	
* Bridge Re-write: ALL Bridges have been COMPLETELY re-written to properly support the external CMS
	systems.

* Password Changing and "I forgot my password" implementation for all bridges. (See Notes Below).

* Several Bugs have been fixed.

TEMPLATE CREATORS PLEASE NOTE
------------------------------
The scripts directory that used to be in templates/XXXXXXX/scripts has been removed.  This scripts
directory now resides in the root of the WRM installation (same place as the "auth" or "templates"
directory).  Please update your templates to remove your local scripts directory.

PASSWORD CHANGING IMPLEMENTED
-----------------------------
Two brand new features have been added for password changing.  First is a "Forgot Your Password?" link
that shows up when a user is not logged in.  This link takes you to a form to fill out that will randomly
generate and e-mail a new WRM password to a user.  The username and associated e-mail address are
required.

The second feature is a "Click to Change Password" link that has been added to a logged in user.  Clicking
this link will take you to another form that requires current password and New and Confirm passwords for
the current user (only the current user's password can be changed).

BOTH of these functions are controlled by a flag current set in the bridge authentication file itself.
In any bridge file (<wrm_base_dir>/auth) is a line "$BridgeSupportPWDChange = FALSE;".  This line
determines the ability of WRM to change passwords.  For the iUMS (Integrated User Management System) this
is turned ON by default.  For all other bridges this is turned off (FALSE).  Turning this on for any
bridge other than iUMS causes the WRM system to be able to change the password IN THE CMS SYSTEMS TABLES.
And thus change the password not only for WRM but for the CMS/BB System as well.

In my opinion, I do not believe that WRM should be changing passwords in a CMS system.  If the user wants
a WRM password change they should change their CMS password and it will filter down to WRM.  That said
there is some convenience to allowing users to change passwords in EITHER WRM or the CMS and have them
synced.

** NOTE ** IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO HAVE DIFFERENT PASSWORDS FOR WRM AND A CMS WHEN USING A CMS BRIDGE.
If you choose to use a bridge other than iUMS, the passwords between WRM and the CMS must ALWAYS be the 
same.  It is impossible using the supplied code not to meet this condition.

If you wish to have WRM allowed to change the CMS system password, you can edit the above BridgeSupport
variable to "TRUE" in place of the "FALSE" and the password change links will start showing up at the 
next page reload.  

Note that ALL SUPPORTED CMS/BB SYSTEMS have been FULLY tested with the password change ability and all
password changes for all bridges with one exception work flawlessly.  HOWEVER for phpBB3 the generated 
password has NEVER been tested and is expected not to work.  The phpBB3 Password change SHOULD REMIAIN
OFF (FALSE).  Unpredictable results could happen if you turn on password change ability when using the 
phpBB3 bridge.

As always I and WRM are NOT RESPONSIBLE for any damage or any problems you encounter by turning on
the password change functionality.  The WRM team will provide LIMITED support for issues encountered
through the use of password change problems related to CMS systems.  If you turn on password changes for
a CMS/BB Bridge, you are taking responsiblity for any problems encountered by the CMS.

information.

0000055 - PHPBB3 Bridge Fails with Multi-Byte Characters

0000057 - The name of the month is not shown in the correct language (calendar).
0000058 - Month and Year tag in calendar view are not shown in set locale.

New Bridges Supported
-----------------------
* Joomla

Unfinished/Incomplete
----------------------
* Starting Day is set inside the calendar file, not as a dropdown in configuration.  To change the "first"
day of the week, you need to modify the calendar.  On line 100, change the word "Sunday" to the localized
name of the day of the week to start on (the only two supported days are "Sunday" and "Monday" at the
moment.)
* CMS Bridges supporting password changing should not be a variable in the bridge but should be a
configuration option.  At this point, however, to turn on password changes for bridges you will need to
modify the <wrm_base_dir>/auth/*.php file related to the bridge you have installed.
