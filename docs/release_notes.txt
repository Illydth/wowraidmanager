Release 3.2 of WoW Raid Manager
--------------------------------
NAME CHANGE: phpRaid is now WOW Raid Manager.  All displayed strings should now note the
name change.  

SECURITY: This is the security release of WRM.  The whole code base should now be significantly
more secure than it was in the past.  Please see the www.wowraidmanager.net website for
information on the security update.

* Updated the template.php file from the phplib release 7.4a.  This changes the class
name form "Page" to "Template" but other than that everything should function normally.
See the "template.php" file for release notes for the 7.4a version of template.php.

* BUG: Fixed bug with minutes dropdown.  It was showing 00, 15, 30, 45, 60, it should now be
showing only 00, 15, 30, 45.

* Feature: Added the configuration of the RSS feed to the configuration area and removed it
from the rss.php file.  It is no longer necessary (or wanted) to go into the rss.php file
and change strings to configure RSS.  Go into the configuration area and configure the rss
feed from there.


Release 3.1.2 of phpRaid
-------------------------
This is a bugfix release that fixes the following errors:

* BUG Fix: Fixed an issue where Raid Leaders could not create teams for their own raids.  
The raid leader could click on the "create teams" link in the "details" page of a raid 
but would get an "insufficient privileges" message returned to them.

* BUG Fix: When a User or Raid Leader clicks the "delete" button next to a user in the 
cancelled status on the raid information page, the user is taken back to the front page 
(index) without deleting the cancelled signup.

* BUG Fix: Accidental changes to the LUA Output files rendered the phpRaidViewer UI Mod
in game inoperable with 3.1.1 of phpRaid.

Open Issues: 

* Possible open issue of raid leaders not being able to promote members from queued status.
* Possible open issue of not being able to use a port to connect to an SQL server.


Release 3.1.1 of phpRaid.
--------------------------
* Added signup flow control to config area.  There are now Check boxes for each button seen
by a user in the raid signup area.  For each state, each of the three user groups (users, 
Raid Leaders and Administrators) can now be given access to each of the 4 actions available
to that state.  This is the new signup flow overhaul that is mentioned below in 3.1.0.  It
is no longer necessary (nor wanted) to modify the code to get the proper sign up control.
Each phpRaid admin can now set their own signup flow through the config options.

* Deprecated "PutOnQueue" option, this is now controlled by the Raid Signup Flow checkboxes
in the config area.  To get the same thing as "put on queue" used to give you, in the 
canceled and drafted area for the "User" set the "Queue" checkbox for both.  

* Due to complaints of a confusing front page interface, the "signup" graphic that used to
be used on the front page to indicate the user has the ability to sign up for the raid
(the white U shaped arrow pointing up) has been removed and changed to a link saying 
"Sign Up" for clarity sakes.  The Green Check mark and red Circle with Slash still remain 
the same.  If anyone has a strong preference one way or the other please let me know.  You 
can re-enable the U shaped arrow by uncommenting the appropriate line in the index.php file.
If there's enough issue with this i'll make a configuration option for text information or
graphical information in that area. 

* Due to confusing language the "Auto-Queue" option in the configuration section has now
changed to "Disallow Signup to Drafted Status".  The effect of this option is the same as 
before.  It forces the user to sign up to the "queued" status instead of
allowing signups to the drafted status...more practically it removes the "Signup as Available"
selection in the "How do you want to Signup?" dropdown box.

* BUG Fix: Fixed issue with installation of phpraid and phpbb auth types: They weren't using
the right hidden field names for the auth_type which caused installation to take you to the
wrong step and as such the installation would never finish.

* BUG Fix: When you queue from cancel as a normal user you get a hacking attempt.  This has
been fixed.

Up Comming Changes
-------------------
* To DO: Fix link that points in installation to Spiffy JR site, doesn't work.  Point to
local documentation or wiki.

* New Feature: Allow admin/RL to add people to queued area.  May need special highlight/note 
to ensure that players know they were admin added.

* New Feature: Allow Admin to select start page (either calendar or Top Down)?

* New Feature: Impliment Signup to Drafted, Signup To Queued, Signup To Cancel configuration
options.  This allows the admin to select the dropdown values available to the user when they
signup.  This will replace "auto queue" flag.  Should work in conjunction with signup flow
to allow users to queue themselves in various statuses.  Check the "users can put themselves
on queue" configuration option to verify what this does and how this works with the "auto
queue" option here.

* New Feature: Add a configuration option to change the authentication type from XXX to
phpraid.  Maybe add an ability to switch between any of the chosen authentication types.

* New Feature: Complete Security Overhaul for all of phpRaid, including a new function 
to determine the state you're in, what your rights are, and to return a "true/false" 
to check a hacking attempt.

Release 3.1.0 of phpRaid.
----------------------------
phpRaid has new "management".  As phpRaider from SpiffyJr had replaced phpRaid
as the raid scheduling system he was putting his time into, the phpRaid code
was considered dead.  Since phpRaid still has an online community, and since
the code for phpRaid was accessable at the time of this writing, I have decided 
to carry it along.

This update contains some basic changes that make it more functional for my
guild.  Where appropriate i've tried to include options to get the system to 
work as it always has in the past.  In the few instances where i've changed 
functionality to make it different from the 3.0.9.2 system I have tried to 
document those areas, both in code as well as here in the notes.

If there are changes that have made the system unliveable to the users for your 
specific guild please let me know and i'll be happy to try to get a release out
that manages those areas better.  The intent of 3.1.0 is as a drop in replacement
update of all prior versions of code, not as a system written specifically for
my needs or a handfull of guilds.

Modifications for 3.1.0 are listed below:
-------------------------------------
* New Extensible Authentication System.  While writing new authentication modules
is still a codeing project, the concepts behind writing a module to link in with
another system have been made easier.  There are now 4 functions that need to be
written to install a new authentication system.  There is no need to touch any
of the base phpRaid code to add a new system to authenticate against.  See
authenticating_against_new_cms.txt in the docs directory for more information.

* Support for the e107 CMS system.  e107 is now a natively supported system for 
user authentication.  Please see the documentation in the install/auth/
directory in the install_e107.php file.  This is in addition to the phpBB and
phpRaid authentication that already existed.

* Support for three distinct classes of users.  Raid Administrators (those with
the raids permission set in the permissions area), Raid Leaders (the user who
started and thus owns a raid, displayed as "Leader" (used to be officer) on the
raid list, and "Users", those people signing up for a raid who are not Admins 
or the RL.  This change allows those with "Raids" permissions to be granted
enhanced permissions for raid signups or to administrate multiple raids at once.
This change helps support the phpRaid system being used for 5 man group signup
as well.

* Group Support.  phpRaid has been changed at a fundamental level to support
being used as a signup system for 5 man groups as well as raids.  Please see
the online documentation "enable_groups.htm" in the docs folder for more
information, you can access this documentation through the "help" link on the
phpRaid configuration page under the "Enable Groups" checkbox.

* New more easily modified user signup flow.  For those guilds who have a
slightly different process for signing up users for their raids, the phpRaid
system now supports an easier method of changing what buttons users have access
to.  In the "signup_flow.php" file are 3 functions, one controls user access
when they're in the queue, one controls access when they're in the "signed up"
area, and one controls the access for users in the cancelled area.  Simply 
turning on and off buttons in the documented "if" statements will change the
process flow to allow more or less access or even completely changed process 
flows.  

Note: this is a temporary solution till I can get a fully functional
configuration based system up and running for this.  Look for it in the next
version of the software.

Note: The default signup flow (what buttons users have access to) may have 
changed in this version.  If you are finding that your users aren't able
to do things they're used to doing, or can do more than they should, you 
can easily edit signup_flow.php (read the comments) to modify the behavior.

* Granularity for time dropdowns (Signup Time, Raid Time, etc.) has been changed
to 15 minute intervals.  Users will no longer be able to schedule a raid for 
8:07 pm with a signup time of 7:32 pm.  Instead your "Minute" options are: 00,
15,30,45.  While this is a basic change to the system, I simply don't see the
need to populate the dropdown with (and thus force people to scroll through) 60 
options when 4 is really sufficient.  I could be convinced to go to 10 minute
granularity instead of 15, but really i've never encounterd a guild that is so
punctual as to be able to make an 8:05 raid start time as opposed to 8:06.

* To support the 3 levels of raid access introduced in 3.1.0 (see above) and 
the 5 man group support added for phpRaid in this version, the name "officer"
in the header of the raids listing has been changed to "Leader", the underlaying
database and code has NOT been changed to reflect the new name, only the display.

Fixes for 3.1.0
-----------------
* Locations with a ' in them (For instance "Gruul's Lair" or "Onyxia's Lair"
were failing to load properly when creating new raids or editing raids.  The 
problem with the underlaying java code is now fixed.

* Install addendum.txt file mistakenly named "Install addendum..txt" (two dots)
this has been renamed.
