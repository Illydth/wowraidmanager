# 0.4.2 - "Fishing Extravaganza" - Dec 17, 2008
This release should fix issues with character that could not be retrieved
from the armory due to special characters in realm or character names.

## Bugs squashed
* phpArmory5Cache: the setCachedData(...) function was called without prior
  checks if there *was* any valid data to cache. This has been fixed.
* phpArmory5: Strings used in URLs do not need a manual replacement of the
  space character. urlencode() handles this for us already.
* phpArmory5: fixed an issue in __construct, where required PHP extension
  have not been checked properly. Thanks to Gizzmo for the hint.

## Features added
* phpArmory5: added getAnyData($searchType = NULL, $objectName = NULL,
  $filter = NULL). $searchType can be any of "arenateams", "characters",
  "guilds", "items". $filter needs to be an associative array of filter
  properties. For now, try out the armory item search page to see valid
  filter options.
* phpArmory5: added a third parameter to getCharacterData for retrieving only
  the basic character data. Defaults to false. Use the following to get basic
  character data only:

        !!php
        $character = $phpArmory->getCharacterData($characterName = "Char", $realmName = "Realm", $onlyBasicData = true)

# 0.4.1 - "Call to Arms" - Nov 26, 2008
The [World of Warcraft armory](http://www.wowarmory.com/) has received quite a
few improvements, making it feature complete with the added character data from
the "Wrath of the Lich King" expansion.

## Features added
* getCharacterData($characterName, $realmName) will now return an array which
  contains character achievements and statistics.

        !!php
        $character = Array
        (
            [characterinfo] => Array
                (
                        ...
                )

            [reputationtab] => Array
                (
                        ...
                )

            [skilltab] => Array
                (
                        ...
                )

            [talenttab] => Array
                (
                        ...
                )

            [achievements] => Array
                (
                        ...
                )

            [statistics] => Array
                (
                        ...
                )

            [armorypatchlevel] => 030003
        )


# 0.4.0 - “Jack-o’-Lantern” - Nov 20, 2008

phpArmory has been rewritten for PHP5 and the new OOP class syntax. The class
interfaces have been changed to use getFunction() and setFunction() syntax,
and class variables have been adjusted to use private, protected, and public
states. Please consult the doc/ folder for updated API documentation.

NOTE: arena team handling has been postponed to release 0.5.0, as with the
recent release of Wrath of the Lich King, all arena teams have been wiped and
no sample data was available to develop the feature.

## Bugs squashed

* all functions have received input checking, now all functions will properly
  return FALSE when something goes wrong.

## Features added

* phpArmory5 and phpArmory5Cache will now make use of trigger_error provided by
  PHP5 to raise notices (E_USER_NOTICE), warnings (E_USER_WARNING), and errors
  (E_USER_ERROR). Please note that warnings and notices will only be raised when
  you use phpArmory from the command line. If you use it on your web server,
  only errors will be raised.
* you can now use getArea / setArea to make changes to the armory area.
* you can now use getLocale / setLocale to set the language in which you want
  to query data from the armory.
* you can retrieve talent definitions for all classes, including the recently
  added Death Knight using getTalentData().

## Features changed

* the phpArmory class API has been changed. All functions now use get... and
  set... for their names. The current API documentation is available online:
  http://www.marenkay.com/wp-content/plugins/wow-armory/phparmory/doc/
* character icons will now be properly display for characters up to level 80.
  We have shiny WotLK character icons.

# 0.3.2 - “Giddyup!” - Oct 02, 2008

A pure bugfix release.

## Bugs squashed

* phpArmory.class.php: Class will not be instantiated if the Curl or XML
  extension is missing from your PHP installation.
* examples/character.php: Updated to use setArea. Properly dumps character data
  as XML. Please note that characterFetch() will now return the armory
  patchlevel, too.
* examples/guildroster.php: Updated to use setArea. Properly dumps the full
  guild roster as plain table.

# 0.3.1 - “Unknown item” - Sep 28, 2008

A few features have been revised, a few new ones added.

## Features added

* Patchlevel detection: getCurrentPatchlevel() will return the current patch
  version for the armory region you use.
* Talent definitions: TalentDefinitionFetch() will retrieve talent definition
  for all classes from the World of Warcraft website.
* WoW armory lockout prevention: with previous phpArmory versions, it could
  happen that your applications would be temporarily locked out from the
  armory. To prevent this, you can now limit the number of retries for XML
  pulling. To do this inherit your own classes like this:

  <?php
  $armoryFetch = new phpArmory ($armory = "http://www.wowarmory.com/", retries = 3);
  ?>

## Features changed

* Armory region and locales: this has been simplified, to only supply a setArea
  function to define which armory region we use.

# 0.3.0 - “Use soulstone” - Apr 30, 2008

Mostly bug fixes, a few new features.

## Features added

* Language support. You now can define and query the language, in which you
  want to query data from the World of Warcraft armory.
* Region support. You now can define a regions' armory to query data from it.
  This is especially helpful, if querying character data from different regions
  (e.g. US and EU characters).

## Bugs squashed

* The xmlToArray method was not properly checking, if children of the XML
  objects are proper arrays.
* Caching XML data retrieved from the World of Warcraft armory works again.
* MySQL query results will now be stored correct. The cacheSave() method was
  not checking, if an XML result was already stored in the database, and thus
  produced a duplicate key error. Now existing XML results will be updated
  instead of inserted.
