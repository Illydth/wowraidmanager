# phpArmory - Work the World of Warcraft armory as you desire

## Summary

phpArmory is a PHP class library that can easily fetch and unserialize World
of Warcraft Armory XML data into structured associative arrays.

This class library requires the PHP extensions for CURL, and XML installed.
Please make sure that these extensions are installed on your server.

## Usage

Include phpArmory.class.php as the base class in your project, and inherit
new classes from the `phpArmory5` class.

If you need caching of the retrieved XML results, include the caching class
from phpArmoryCache.class.php in your project, and inherit new classes from
the `phpArmory5Cache` class.

## Notes

* With the release of phpArmory 0.4.0 support for running the classes with
  PHP4 has been dropped, due to PHP4 not being supported by the developers
  anymore. Thus we recommend to upgrade your PHP installation to PHP5 now.

* The phpArmory API has changed with phpArmory 0.4.0 and is not backwards
  compatible.
