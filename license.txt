A note about the license surrounding phpRaid.

It has come to my attention, through conversations with a few of my users, 
that the phpRaid software, versions 3.1.0, 3.1.1 and 3.1.2 are NOT properly 
released under the terms of the GNU GPL.

Specifically, 

* the Copyright Notices have not been updated throughout the code.
* The proper header on all files has not been made on all files.
* No copy of the GNU GPL has been distributed with the software.

There may be other, smaller issues with the GNU License, but the above have 
been identified as existing issues.

To clarify:

THIS SOFTWARE HAS, IS, AND WILL BE RELEASED ACCORDING TO THE GNU GENERAL PUBLIC
LICENSE unless otherwise noted to the community at large.  The failure of the 
current and any past versions of the software to properly meet the requirements
of the license DOES NOT invalidate the license as a whole.

While I realize that this may not be legaly binding and is certainly not a "good 
enough", it will have to do till I get the time to properly bring the code up 
to the reqirements of the GNU GPL.  

This said, I am officially announcing the release of phpRaid fully under the 
GNU GPL v2 or any later version of the GNU GPL license (it always has been, i'm 
just doing my best to make this as legal as possible).

As of this statement, I am hereby stating all copyright notices in the code and 
software at large should read: Copyright (C) 2007 Douglas Wagner

All code headers should read:

    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
    along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.
    
Lastly in the 3.1.2 release I have included a file gpl-3.0.txt that contains
the GNU GPL v3 License.

Please note this license file has been written with the intent to SUPERCEED any 
other liceses and/or copyrights distributed in the code itself.  As the original
software was produced under the GNU GPL I have been given rights by the GPL to 
do this.
